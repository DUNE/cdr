This is the Conceptual Design Report for the next long-baseline
experiment at Fermilab.

The definitive source for guidance for CDR authors is availble in the
document:

  volume-readme.pdf
  volume-readme.tex

It is also written following its own guidance so serves as an example.

Each volume-*.tex is a stand-alone document and is intended to be
compiled using "pdflatex":

  pdflatex volume-readme.tex

Substitute "readme" for other volume names.
