\label{Sec:cryo-cryosys-cryostat}

\section{Sides and Bottom of Cryostat}

The membrane cryostat is a sealed container that relies on external support 
from the surrounding steel frame to resist the hydrostatic load of the 
contents. In order from innermost to outermost layers, the side walls 
of the membrane cryostat consist of the stainless-steel primary membrane; 
insulation (inner layer); a secondary barrier (thin aluminum membrane 
that contains the LAr in case of a leak in the primary membrane); 
more insulation (outer layer); a barrier to prevent water-vapor 
ingress to the cryostat; and finally the steel frame.  
The membrane cryostat is considered a ``full containment'' 
system in the LNG industry lexicon. The basic components of the 
membrane cryostat are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:composite-sys-install}.
The cryostat is positioned inside the rock pit with 0.29 m air space 
reserved (convection or forced air circulation), which maintains rock 
temperatures above freezing and provides clearance required between 
steel frame and rock for the sides and bottom (detailed floor strategy TBD).

\section{Steel Frame and Vapor Barrier}
%The formed concrete liner will be poured against the sides 
%and bottom of the excavated rock pit. Conduits and heating 
%elements will be embedded in the concrete liner

. %The embedded conduits are encased approximately midway in 
%the concrete side walls, end walls and bottom floor slab 
%as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:endview-liner}. 
%The concrete liner and conduits are provided under the 
%conventional facilities scope. The heating elements are 
%provided by LBNF scope.

A vapor barrier is required on all internal surfaces of the 
steel frame (base, side walls, and end walls) and the roof to 
prevent the ingress of any water vapor into the insulation 
space. If water vapor were permitted to migrate into the 
insulation space, it could freeze and degrade the thermal 
performance of the insulation. The barrier must also 
reliably absorb the stresses and strains from all normal 
loading conditions. The selected vapor barrier material 
is a steel plate for the side and bottom surfaces. 
%This has been used extensively in onshore LNG tank applications.  
The vapor barrier for the top will be solid steel plate 
welded together to the underside of the roof truss.


\section{Insulation System and Secondary Membrane}
\label{subsec:insul-2nd-mem}

The membrane cryostat requires insulation applied between the 
primary stainless steel membrane and the moisture barrier and 
roof in order to minimize the heat ingress and the required 
refrigeration load. Choosing a reasonable insulation 
thickness of 80~cm, given an average conductivity coefficient 
for the insulation material of C $\approx$ 0.0283~W/m-K, the 
heat input is expected to be 29.8~kW 
per cryostat. %This is shown in Table~\ref{table:heat-load-calc}.  


% deleted \caption{Heat load calculation (Thickness = 1~m for all) }
% deleted \label{table:heat-load-calc}

The insulation material, a solid fiberglass foam, is manufactured in 1 m 
$\times$ 3 m composite panels. The panels will be laid out in a grid with 
3 cm gaps between them (these will be filled with loose fiberglass) and 
fixed onto anchor bolts embedded into the steel outer structure
at $\sim$3 m intervals. 
The composite panels contain an outer insulation layer, the secondary 
membrane and an inner insulation layer. After positioning adjacent 
composite panels and filling the 3 cm gap, the secondary membrane 
is spliced together by epoxying. All seams are covered so that the secondary
membrane is a continuous liner. A corner detail is shown 
in Figure~\ref{fig:vessel-corner}.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{v5ch2-vessel-corner}
\caption{Membrane corner detail}
\label{fig:vessel-corner} %fig from email from russ 10/25
\end{figure}

The secondary membrane is comprised of a thin aluminum sheet and 
fiberglass cloth. The fiberglass-aluminum-fiberglass composite is 
very durable and flexible with an overall thickness of $\sim$1~mm.  
The secondary membrane is placed within the insulation space. It 
surrounds the internal tank on the bottom and sides, and it 
separates the insulation space into two distinct, leak-tight, 
inner and outer volumes. The outer insulation separates this 
membrane from the steel frame. This secondary membrane is connected 
to embedded metal plates in the vertical steel wall at the upper 
edge of the tank. In the unlikely event of an internal leak from 
the cryostat's primary membrane into the inner insulation space, 
the liquid cryogen will be contained in the 
secondary membrane volume.  

\section{Cryostat Layers as Packaged Units}
Membrane tank vendors have a ``cryostat in a kit'' design that 
incorporates insulation and secondary barriers into packaged units. See Figure~\ref{fig:gst-composite}.  
Figure~\ref{fig:composite-sys-install} illustrates how these layers would be used in the LBNF reference design.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{v5ch2-gst-composite}
\caption{GST composite system from GTT}
\label{fig:gst-composite}
\end{figure}

\section{Top of Cryostat}

The stainless-steel primary membrane and the intermediate layers of 
insulation and water-vapor barrier continue across the top of the 
cryostat, providing a vapor-tight seal.  Note that no secondary 
membrane is required for the cryostat top. The cryostat 
roof is a steel truss structure that bridges the detector. The truss 
construction is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:roof-truss}. Stiffened 
steel plates hermetically welded to the underside of the truss form 
a flat vapor barrier surface onto which the roof insulation attaches 
directly. Fully fabricated roof
trusses are placed across the roof with a 2.5 m spacing. Field-fabricated 
truss members and steel plates are welded between the prefabricated 
trusses to connect the two prefabricated sections.  The roof is built 
up of alternating prefabricated and field-fabricated ``in-fill'' roof 
sections.  This configuration was selected during the screening process 
because it provides an efficient, gas-tight solution that can be 
readily constructed within the cavern space.

The roof truss structure is anchored to the top of the steel walls 
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:composite-sys-install} 
where a positive structural connection between the steel and the 
truss is made to resist the upward (lifting) force caused by the 
internal cryostat pressure. The hydrostatic load of the LAr in the 
cryostat is carried by the steel frame on sides and bottom. Everything 
else within the cryostat (TPC planes, electronics, sensors,
cryogenic and gas connections) is supported by the 
steel plates under the truss structure. All piping (except for 
piping connections form the recirculation pumps) and electrical 
penetrations into the interior of the cryostat are made through 
this top plate to minimize the potential for leaks.

Studs are welded to the underside of the steel plates to bolt the 
insulation panels to the steel plates. Insulation plugs are inserted 
into the bolt-access holes.  The primary membrane panels (also 
manufactured in smaller sheets) are first tack-welded then fully 
welded to complete the inner cryostat volume. Feed-through 
ports located at regular intervals within the corrugation pattern
of the primary membrane to accommodate TPC hangers, electrical 
and fiber-optic cables, and piping are
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:v5ch2-roof-nozzle}. 
The roof truss will be pre-fabricated 
off-site in $\sim$2~m wide, fully-welded modules and transported to
the cavern as required by the installation schedule.
%AH moved from under circulation
The prefabricated steel roof-truss modules are relatively 
lightweight ($\sim$8,000~kg each) and require only moderate 
crane capacity.  If the steel trusses need to be separated 
into smaller pre-fabricated units for transport to the 
%shallow or deeper 
underground site, assembly within the cavern space prior to 
installation is relatively straightforward. 

Some equipment, such as monitoring instrumentation and pumps, 
will be installed within wells extending through the roof 
structure. All connections into the cryostat (except for 
connections from the recirculation pumps) will be made 
via nozzles or penetrations above the maximum liquid level 
and mostly located on the roof of the cryostat. See figure 
\ref{fig:v5ch2-roof-nozzle} for a typical roof-port 
penetration.

\chapter{Leak Prevention}
\label{sec:cryo-cryosys-leak}

The primary membrane will be subjected to several leak tests 
and weld remediation, as necessary. All (100\%) of the welds 
will be tested by an Ammonia Colorimetric Leak Test (ASTM E1066-95) 
in which welds are painted with a reactive yellow paint before 
injecting gas with 25\% ammonia into the bottom insulation space 
of the cryostat.  Wherever the paint turns purple or blue, a leak 
is present. Any and all leaks will be repaired. The test will last 
more than 20 hours per cryostat and is sensitive enough to 
detect defects down to 0.003~mm in size and to a 10$^{-7}$ 
std-cm$^3$/s leak rate (equivalent leak at standard pressure 
and temperature, 1~atm and 273~K). Both membrane cryostat 
manufucturers use this technique for certifying that 
a cryostat is leak-tight.

%\section{Insulation Purge system}

To prevent infiltration of water-vapor or oxygen through 
microscopic membrane leaks (below detection level) the 
insulation spaces will be continuously purged to provide 
one volume exchange per day.  

The insulation space between the primary and 
secondary barriers will be maintained at 15 mbarg,  
slightly above atmospheric pressure. This space will
be monitored for changes that might indicate a leak 
from the primary membrane.  The outer insulation space 
will also be purged with argon at a slightly different 
pressure. The pressure gradient across the membrane walls 
will be maintained in the outward direction. Pressure-control 
devices and relief valves will be installed on both insulation 
spaces to ensure that the pressures in those spaces do not 
exceed the operating pressure inside the cryostat. 

The purge gas will be recirculated by a blower to a small 
purge gas dryer and reused as purge gas. The purge system 
is not safety-critical, and an outage of the blower would 
have only a minimal, short-term impact on operations~\cite{docdb4303}.

\chapter{Cryogenic System Layout}
\label{sec:cryo-cryosys-layout}

Cryogenic system components are located on the surface or within 
the cavern area. Figure~\ref{fig:eqp-at-surface} illustrates 
the cryogenic system layout. On the surface near the Ross 
shaft there will be a cryogen 
receiving station. A 50 m$^3$ (69 tons of LAr capacity) 
vertical dewar will have two LAr truck connections 
to allow for receipt of LAr deliveries for the
filling period. This liquid argon dewar serves as a buffer volume 
to accept liquid argon at a pace of about 5 LAr trailers 
(18 tons per trailer) per day. An analyzer
rack with instruments to check water, nitrogen and oxygen content 
of the trailers is located in the vicinity. A large 
280 kW vaporizer at the surface is used to vaporize the liquid
argon from the storage dewar prior to the argon gas being 
transferred by uninsulated piping down the Ross shaft.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fd-cryosys-equip-location} 
\caption{Graphical illustrations showing major pieces of equipment and their location at the
surface, piping down the Ross shaft, and in the cavern area}
\label{fig:eqp-at-surface}
\end{figure}


Another 50 m$^3$ vertical dewar and fill connection will be 
available near the liquid argon dewar. This dewar is used 
to accept nitrogen deliveries for the initial charging and startup of
the nitrogen refrigerator. It is also used for pressure control of 
the liquid argon storage dewar. A large vaporizer for the nitrogen 
circuit nearby converts liquid to gas to feed the compressors 
of the nitrogen refrigerator. Four compressors are located in 
a compressor building on the surface near the Ross shaft and cryogen
receiving area. The compressors require a closed-loop water 
cooling circuit with recirculation pumps in the compressor 
building and an evaporative cooling tower located outside 
near the vaporizers. The compressors are only refrigeration-cycle 
components located on the surface. 
The reason why compressors were chosen to be on the 
surface is the electrical power and cooling supply 
much cheaper to provide at the surface rather 
than at deep depth in the mine. Each compressor is an 
1500 horsepower machine running at 4160 volts. 
Four running compressors will require a total of
2.6 MW of electrical power at the surface.
The compressors discharge high pressure (1.1 MPa) nitrogen gas into
pipes that run down the Ross shaft.

The Ross shaft contains the vertical pipelines connecting the 
surface equipment with the equipment in the cavern area. The 
vertical piping run is described in 
Chapter~\ref{sec:cryo-cryosys-pipework-surface-cav}. 
The piping run consists of a gas argon transfer line and the 
GN$_2$ compressor suction and discharge lines. At the bottom of 
the Ross shaft at the 4850 level, the piping exits the 
shaft and runs along a drift to the cavern area.

The central utility cavern at the 4850 level contains the
equipment for the nitrogen refrigerator (such as LN$_2$ cold 
boxes, LN$_2$ dewars and other peripheral equipment)
and argon purification/filtration, which will be
described more in Chapter \ref{sec:cryo-cryosys-equip-cavern}. 
In the cavern, the nitrogen refrigerator equipment 
is positioned in the opposite side of the Ross shaft to
provide optimized paths for ventilation. Fresh ventilation 
air is supplied down the Ross shaft, enters the detector caverns 
and flows over the cryostats or the refrigerator
equipment in the central utility cavern before being 
exhausted out.

There are four argon recondensers per cryostat. They are 
placed above each cryostat. Four 23 m$^3$/hr recirculation 
pumps per cryostat to circulate liquid from the bottom 
of the cryostat through the purifier are set close to 
each cryostat as well. Each pump will have a sidewall
penetration to the membrane cryostat. 


\chapter{Pipework between Surface and Cavern}
\label{sec:cryo-cryosys-pipework-surface-cav}

The piping between the surface and cavern area is located in a utility 
chase down the Ross shaft. See Figure~\ref{fig:framing-at-ross-piping}. 
The piping material is single wall carbon steel coated with a corrosion 
barrier. Table~\ref{table:pipelines} lists the piping and its duty 
and size. The frictional pressure drop for the supply pipes matches
the pressure gained due to the static head from elevation change. 
All the piping connections will be made with victaulic fittings. 
The nitrogen and argon 
being transferred in the Ross shaft piping will be at ambient 
temperature, in the gas phase. Having gas phase only in the 
1.5 km vertical piping is an advantage over liquid transfer 
because the hydrostatic head for gas only piping is on the order of
0.05 MPa, whereas for the liquid transfer it is 20 MPa. If 
liquid was transferred it would require on the order of
seven pressure reducing stations evenly spaced along the vertical drop.
Using liquid cryogen delivery was considered in the March 
2012 LBNE CDR. However, the cost of providing 
the excavated spaces and pressure reducing stations was costly 
as compared to using gas only transfer. For a liquid transfer
option with pressure reducing stations, the piping would need 
to be routed down the Oro Hondo ventilation shaft which would 
need rehabilitation. With gas 
only transfer to the cavern, we can run straight piping down 
the Ross shaft. The drawback of gas only transfer is that one 
must provide the liquid nitrogen refrigeration in the cavern 
to fill the cryostats by liquid argon condensation. Filling 
each cryostat with liquid argon in a reasonable period of 
time is a driving factor to determine the size of the 
refrigerator and condenser.

\end{table}

A preliminary oxygen deficiency hazard (ODH) assessment for 
the piping in the Ross shaft has been done. The mine fresh 
air ventilation is sizeable, 100,000 cfm supplied down the 
Ross and Yates shafts. If any of the pipes for the cryogenic 
system are ruptured in the shaft, they would only be able 
to reduce the oxygen content to a fraction of 20.5\%, 
thus not being an oxygen deficiency concern.

\chapter{Equipment in the Cavern Area}
\label{sec:cryo-cryosys-equip-cavern}

There are four independent 78 kW (maximum capacity: 20\% up above nominal) 
nitrogen refrigerators in the cavern area. The nitrogen
refrigerator heat exchangers and expander sets are located 
at the east end of the central utility cavern.
The heat exchangers (1.2 m diameter $\times$ 9.1 m long) 
will be in a horizontal orientation in order to
fit them within the cavern. The liquid nitrogen produced 
by the refrigerators is stored in six horizontal 
12.5 m$^3$ (1.2 m diameter $\times$ 11 m long) liquid 
nitrogen vessels per cryostat that are mounted in the
central utility cavern. These liquid nitrogen vessels
in turn feed the argon condensers that are connected 
to the cryostat. The returning nitrogen gas from the 
condensers is routed through the refrigerator heat 
exchangers and warmed to ambient temperature. The 
nitrogen gas is then boosted by four 120 kW 
compressors located in the cavern to 0.19 MPa 
and returned up the nitrogen suction piping 
in the Ross shaft.

Four argon condensers (0.8 m diameter $\times$ 2.0 m long) 
per cryostat are placed above cryostat. The full 
power of the argon condensers is used during the initial 
phase of the cryostats to fill the cryostat by 
condensation of the gas argon transferred down the Ross 
shaft. The fill process is expected to take 12 months 
for the first cryostat and 11 months for the second. 
The fill time durations given here assume two refrigeration 
units available for the first fill and three available for 
the second fill. If the second fill is restricted to two 
refrigeration units then its fill time will be 39 months. 
This duration is calculated with the latest heat estimate 
from electronics which is higher than previous ones. 
Additional information about the filling process is 
described in Chapter~\ref{sec:cryo-cryosys-proc}.  

%\begin{editornote}
%  Editor's Note:  Filling times in preceding sentences refer to filling two 17-kton modules.
%\end{editornote}


Purification filters are located in the central utility cavern 
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:det-cavern-purif}. The filters (1.0 m
diameter $\times$ 4.3 m high) contain dual media, a molecular 
sieve for removal of water and a copper coated catalyst media 
for oxygen removal. There is one gas filter that is used during 
the argon filling phase and one liquid filter for each cryostat. 
Associated with the filters, there will be regeneration 
equipment such as heaters, gas blowers, and a hydrogen
generator also located in the central utility cavern.

\chapter{Cryogenic System Process}
\label{sec:cryo-cryosys-proc}
%added by russ 10/6
The entire cryogenic system process is summarized with functions of 
every cryogenic syste components in 
Figure~\ref{fig:v5ch2-LBNF-block-diagram-2014}.  
The major functions serving the cryostat are cryogen supply for 
cool-down and fill, gas filtration, argon condensing, liquid 
filtration and circulation, and argon-purity analysis. 
The methods presented in this section are motivated by
experience from the cryogenic systems of other LArTPC 
experiments, such as ICARUS, LAPD and prototype 35 ton 
membrane cryostat. The piping
connections between major cryogenic system components 
are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:v5ch2-LBNF-cryo-process-2014}.

\section{Cryostat Inital Purge and Cool-down}

After cryostat construction and following installation of all 
scientific equipment, the cryostat will be cleaned, purged and 
cooled. Construction procedures leading up to this point will
ensure that the completed cryostat does not contain debris and is free
of all loose material that may contaminate the LAr.

\subsection{Initial Purge} 

Argon piping will be isolated, evacuated to less than 0.1 mbar 
absolute pressure and backfilled with high-purity argon gas. 
This cycle will be repeated several times to reduce contamination
levels in the piping to the ppm level. The reference-design choice 
for removing air from the membrane cryostat is argon 
flow/piston-purge, introducing the heavy argon gas at the
bottom of the tank and removing the exhaust at the top. The bottom 
field cage (part of the TPC), serves an additional role as a flow 
diffuser during the initial purge. A matrix of small holes in the 
field cage, approximately 10 mm diameter at a 50 mm pitch, 
will provide a uniform flow. 

The flow velocity of the advancing argon-gas volume is set to 1.2 m/hour. 
This is twice the diffusion rate of the air downward into the advancing argon 
so that the advancing pure argon-gas wave front will displace the air rather 
than just dilute it. A 2D ANSYS model of the purge process shows that after 
20 hours of purge and 1.5 volume changes, the air concentration will 
be reduced to less than 1\%. At 40 hours of elapsed time and three volume
changes, the purge process is complete with residual air reduced to a few 
ppm. This simulation includes a representation of the perforated field 
cage at the top and bottom of the detector and heat sources due to the 
readout electronics. The cathode planes are modeled as non-porous 
plates although they will actually be constructed of stainless-steel mesh.

The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the purge process 
has been verified in multiple arrangements: (1) in an instrumented 
cylinder of 1 m diameter by 2 m height, (2) Liquid Argon Purity 
Demonstrator (LAPD), a cylindrical tank of 3 m diameter by 3 m height,
taking gas-sampling measurements at varying heights and times during 
the purge process, and (3) within the 35 ton membrane cryostat, a 
prototype vessel built for LBNE in 2013, of which the results 
are found at~\cite{Montanari:2013/06/13aqa} % used label from inspirehep {35ton-prototype}.

\subsection{Water Removal via Gas Flow}

Water and oxygen will be removed continuously from the system for several days following the
initial purge. Flowing gas will be used at the same rate, however at this stage the gas will
be filtered and recirculated. Each cryostat contains five tons of FR4
circuit-board material and a
smaller inventory of plastic-jacketed power and signal cables. These somewhat porous
materials may contain as much as 0.5\% water by weight. Water-vapor outgassing from these
materials will be entrained in the gas flow exiting
the top of the cryostat and will be removed
from the gas stream by filters. Adsorbed water will also be removed from the metallic inner
surfaces of the cryostat and piping system. Water deep within porous materials will remain;
this is not a problem since
the water diffusion rate in FR4 at room temperature is already 
quite low (0.3~$\mu m^2 /s$) and the FR4 assemblies are relatively thick (1~cm).

\subsection{Alternative Water-Removal Method: Evacuation}

Another method for removing water and oxygen from LArTPC experiments 
is to evacuate the tank to $\sim$10$^{-4}$~mbar  and then backfill it with 
pure argon gas. Although the primary membrane of the reference-design 
cryostat is not a vacuum vessel, it is possible to evacuate it.
Membrane-cryostat vendors report that evacuation of  the insulation 
spaces (external to the primary membrane) is normally done during the 
construction and leak-checking phases.  A vacuum pressure of less than 
200~mbar absolute in the insulation spaces has so far been achieved. 
As long as the pressure-differential direction across the walls is 
kept outward, it is possible to reduce the internal membrane-tank 
volume to these pressures as well.  

\subsection{Initial Cool-Down}

Purified LAr will be distributed near
the bottom of the cryostat to cool down the cryostat in a controlled spray.
The boil-off gas will flow through the volume of the cryostat, then
routed to the recondenser and liquid-filtration system. Simulation
has shown that the liquid cool-down method can
be controlled to stay within the available recondenser capacity. The required cooling rate
is determined by the maximum stress that DUNE detector components can
tolerate. For example, the 150 $\mu$m APA wires will cool much more rapidly than the APA frames.
A mass flow control system with temperature-monitoring system will be used to control the
temperature difference across the cryostat. The exact temperature difference required is yet to
be determined; it will be based on input from the cryostat designer and the restrictions from
the TPC components and structure.

\subsection{Initial Purge and Cool-Down Design Features}

Internal piping is positioned within the cryostat to support the purge and cool-down procedure.  Heavy argon vapor, which is a result of cooling down the membrane bottom with liquid, will promote purging after it rises from the base of the cryostat and is vented from the roof level.  The LAr-supply pipework will have nozzles spaced along its length to 
 distribute equal liquid-delivery flow rates across the bottom of the cryostat.  The flow nozzles will be directed downward or to the side so that the injection velocity will not cause local vertical gas plumes or turbulent mixing but rather will spread across the bottom of the tank and produce a stable, upwardly advancing argon wave front. The vertical velocity of 1.2~m/hr for the gas purge includes a contingency for some level of turbulent mixing. 

Main gas returns, used for pressure control, will be distributed along the cryostat roof.  All nozzles and dead-end (stagnant) volumes located at the top of the cryostat will have gas-exhaust lines for the initial purge and for continuous sweep-purge of those volumes during normal operations.  
The sweep-purge during the initial stage of purging will be vented outside of the cavern.  After all but trace amounts of air have been expelled, the gas returns will be routed to the recondensers before being returned to the cryostat.  When cool-down to 120~K is complete (and during steady state operations), the gas returns will be sent to the recondenser to be liquefied by heat exchange with a liquid nitrogen stream.  The recondensed liquid will be filtered and sent back to the cryostat to complete the cool-down operation.
All purge gas will be contained and either vented outside of the cavern at a remote location, or recondensed and reused. 

\section{Liquid Argon Receipt}

Each 10 kton fiducial mass membrane cryostat will hold an inventory 
of 17.1~kton of liquid argon. Considering that some quantities will 
be lost in transit, as a start (17.1+$\alpha$) kton of LAr will need to be 
procured to fill the first cryostat. Planning the supply and logistics 
of LAr delivery to the facility requires consideration of the following issues:

\begin{itemize}
\item  Total capacity of commercial air-separation plants within freight 
distance of the facility (the peak delivery potential)
\item Extent of boil-off that will occur in transit (that is the biggest 
contribution to determine $\alpha$)
\item Number of vehicle movements required and their impact on the local community
\item Costs and benefits associated with stockpiling LAr at the facility
ahead of commencing the purge, cool-down and fill procedure
\item Provision of a temporary air-separation plant at the facility 
to generate liquid argon
\item Availability and cost associated with the delivery of high-purity 
LAr as opposed to lower-quality commercial-grade argon combined with 
on-site coarse purification
\end{itemize}

Total argon production in the United States is currently approximately 
\textcolor{red}{3.6~kton (TBD with market analysis)} per day. Argon is normally co-produced 
along with large volumes of oxygen, so any project that requires large 
oxygen quantities may also spur additional argon production and enhance 
the argon supply capacity.  A 2013-2018 market-forecast report by the Freedonia 
group~\cite{freedonia} indicates that the demand for argon will increase 
at a rate of 3.4\% per year, whereas the demand 
for oxygen will increase 4.8\%.  

The standard grade specification for argon is a minimum purity of
 99.995\%, allowing a maximum concentration of 5.0~ppm for O$_2$ 
and 10.5~ppm for H$_{2}$O.  This is designated as Grade 4.5 in 
the gas-supply industry.  Requiring higher-purity product would 
significantly reduce the volume of product available to the 
experiment, increasing cost and pushing out the schedule.  
Therefore, it is likely that standard product will be 
procured from multiple vendors.  

The most efficient mode of argon delivery seems to be
over-the-road tank truck with a maximum capacity of 18.7~metric ton (MT).  
The expected number of such deliveries per cryostat is about 1000 
over six to ten months (It will take approximately 10/8/6/10 months 
to fill the first/second/third/fourth cryostat; Find more details in 
Chapter \ref{sec:cryo-cryosys-equip-cavern} and Section 
\ref{sec:refrigeration-load-scenarios}). 
Rail delivery is not cost-effective as there are no rail spurs leading
to the SURF site. This mode would require transfer of product from rail 
tanker to a tank truck, introducing cost that exceeds the benefit.

Surface facilities for offloading LN$_{2}$ and LAr road tankers are 
required. It will be necessary to  procure approximately four trailer 
loads of liquid nitrogen (about 40~tons) for the initial filling of 
the LN$_{2}$ refrigeration dewar and charging of a single refrigeration 
plant. Vehicle access and hard-surfaced driving areas are required 
adjacent to the LN$_{2}$ dewar and LAr-supply piping. An interim 
LAr storage dewar will hold the contents of a few road tankers in order 
to minimize off-loading time.  Road tankers will connect to a 
manifold and will use their on-board pumps to transfer the LAr 
to the storage dewar. Each tanker will be tested to ensure that 
the LAr meets the purity specification. The LAr will be 
stored in the surface dewar and vaporized before transporting 
by pipe feed to the underground cavern for liquefaction.

\section{Cryostat Filling}

Liquid argon will be delivered to the cryostat through the 
cryostat-filling pipework. Argon will be piped to the cavern 
in gas form from the surface and condensed/liquefied via the 
LN$_{2}$ exchange in the condenser units. The filling process 
will take place over many months due to the delivery schedule 
of liquid argon described in the previous section and the 
need to condense gaseous argon. Liquid-argon purification 
can begin once the liquid depth reaches about 2 m in the cryostat. 
At this depth, the recirculation pumps can safely
turn on and direct up to 93~m$^{3}$/hr (411~gpm) 
of liquid argon through the purification system.

\section{Argon Reliquefaction and Pressure Control}
\label{subsec:reliquef}

The high-purity liquid argon stored in the cryostat will 
continuously evaporate due to the unavoidable heat ingress.  
The argon vapor (boil-off gas) will be recovered, chilled, 
recondensed and returned to the cryostat. A closed system 
is required in order to prevent the loss of the high-purity argon.

During normal operation the expected heat ingress of approximately 
69.9 kW to the argon system will result in 
an evaporation rate of 1571 kg/hr and expanding in volume by a 
factor of 200 when it changes from the liquid to vapor phase. 
This increase in volume within a closed system will, in the 
absence of a pressure-control system, raise the internal pressure.

In LBNF, argon vapor will be removed from the top of the cryostat 
through the chimneys that contain the cryogenic feedthroughs. As 
the vapor rises, it cools the cables and feedthrough, thereby 
minimizing the outgassing. The exiting gaseous argon will be 
directed to a heat exchanger (a recondenser, illustrated in 
Figure~\ref{fig:v5ch2-recondenser-sept-2011}) in which it is 
chilled against a stream of liquid nitrogen and condensed 
back to a liquid. As the argon vapor cools, its volume 
reduces and in the absence of pressure control further 
gas would be drawn into the heat exchanger, developing 
a thermal siphon.  Therefore, a pressure-control valve on 
the boil-off gas lines will control the flow to the recondenser 
to maintain the pressure within the cryostat at 0.113~MPa $\pm$ 0.008~MPa.  
The liquid nitrogen stream (that provides the coolant for the 
recondenser) will be supplied from a closed-loop LN$_{2}$ refrigeration plant.  
The commercial refrigeration plant uses compression/expansion and heat 
rejection to continuously liquefy and reuse the returning nitrogen 
vapor. The estimated heat loads within the cryostat are listed 
in Table~\ref{table:cryo-heat-loads}.

Each cryostat has a dedicated nitrogen-refrigeration plant 
and all four will be used for the initial 
cooldown of the cryostats because of the large volume of 
gas which must be cooled from 300 K to liquid
argon temperature (88.3$\pm$1 K). Further, each cryostat will
have four 85 kW condensers to 
provide the cooling power needed during initial 
cooldown and filling operations where warm GAr
is cooled and reliquefied to fill the cryostat.
After filling, only one condenser is needed with the
other providing redundancy.
This will ensure the high availability of the recondensing 
system and minimize the need for venting high-purity argon 
or allowing down-time for maintenance of
the recondensers and the refrigeration plants. 

\section{Argon Purification}
\label{subsec:argon-pur}
The cryostat is to be designed with side penetrations below the liquid level 
for external recirculation pumps used to continuously filter the cryostat's 
LAr. Figure~\ref{fig:external-pump} illustrates this mechanism. An Ebara 
model of vertical pump inserted into a pump well, extending down from the 
top of cryostat to the bottom and external to the cryostat, is given 
as a typical example in Figure~\ref{fig:vert-submers-pumps}. The pump suction 
must be located at a minimum distance (normally $\sim$1.5 to 2~m) below 
the lowest liquid level at which they are to pump in order to prevent 
cavitation and vapour-entrapment. The pumps and pump wells will extend 
as close to the bottom of the cryostat.  They 
could also be staggered at different elevations to allow flexibility 
in drawing liquid from different 
elevations. Vertical cryogenic pumps are supplied by manufacturers 
such as Ebara and Carter Cryogenic Products.

\end{figure}

The required flow rate of liquid argon to be sent for purification 
is expected to decrease over time. The initial maximum flow rate 
will be 93~m$^3$/hr (411~gpm). The liquid-argon volume in one 
cryostat will turn over every 5.5 days at this rate. 
Longer term, the rate will decrease to 23~m$^3$/hr 
with a turn-over rate of 22 days.  As a point of comparison, ICARUS 
T600 has a maximum turn-over rate of eight to ten days. See the 
Table~\ref{table:purif-compare} for a comparison of purification 
rates among other experiments and LBNF. 
%To achieve the turn-down required between the short- and long-term flow rates, 
%two removable \textcolor{red}{25~m$^3$/hr (50?) (112~gpm) (224?)} pumps 
%will be located at the end of the cryostat. Placing the pumps at this 
%end of the cryostat will keep space clear for TPC installation. 
The purification skids are located in the central utility cavern.  
The multiple-pump arrangement will provide a very 
high level of redundancy, which will extend the maintenance-free 
operating period of the cryostat.  


The purification system consists of two filter vessels containing
 molecular-sieve and copper media filters. The filter is 1.0~m in 
diameter by 4.3~m tall. The filters are sized to provide effective 
media usage at low pressure drop (2~kPa or 0.3~psi) over the 
expected range of flow rates. One filter is for gas filtration 
during filling; the other is for liquid filtration. After filling 
is complete, the gas filter will be repurposed for liquid filtration.

%The purifiers will be located \textcolor{red}{close to the cryostat} 
%to minimize both the volume of LAr in the circulation pipework 
%and the pump power required to achieve the desired flow rate.  
The cryostat liquid argon inventory is circulated through a purification 
filter to achieve and maintain the required purity. The purification filter,
 containing molecular sieve media to remove water and copper media to 
remove oxygen, will become saturated. The nearly saturated purification 
filter is regenerated to vent the contaminants. The liquid argon flow 
is switched to another purification filter for uninterrupted filtration. 

A purity monitor after the purification filter will monitor the filter effectiveness. (Purity monitors measuring electron lifetime will also be in the LAr bath and resident in the cryostat.  It is a requirement that purity levels reach < 200 ppt oxygen equivalent to match the required electron lifetime of the detector). 

The regeneration of a filter is done in several steps. A saturated purification filter is first warmed with heated argon gas to an elevated temperature driving the captured water into the gas. Hydrogen gas is generated and mixed with the circulating argon gas up to 1.5\% hydrogen by volume. The hydrogen reacts with the oxygen and makes water that is also released into the circulating argon gas.
Argon gas is vented to purge water from the hot circulating gas. 

The hot filter full of regenerated media is cooled by circulating chilled argon gas. The circulating argon gas is chilled first with a heat exchanger using a commercial R-404A refrigeration unit until the filter is cold. The commercial refrigeration unit accumulates the R-404A liquid and shuts down. The filter is next cooled down to cryogenic temperatures by circulating argon gas chilled by a second heat exchanger with a liquid nitrogen coolant. This completes the regeneration steps for a purification filter. The filter is now ready to be switched into service or held cold until needed. Two spare purification filters are used with separate heating and cooling loops to reduce the usage rate of electricity and liquid nitrogen. This also reduces the stresses on heat exchangers by decreasing their temperature swings.

\section{Pressure Control}
\label{sec:press-control}

\subsection{Normal Operations}

The pressure-control valves are sized and set to control the 
internal cryostat pressure under normal operating conditions 
to the nominal design pressure of 0.113~MPa. Fluctuations 
within the range 0.105~MPa (50~mbarg) to 0.121~MPa (200~mbarg) 
will be allowed.
%\fixme{note to self: put this unit in list of abbrevs}).  
Ten percent excursions above or below these levels will set off 
alarms to alert the operator to intervene. Further excursion 
may result in automatic (executive) actions.  These actions may 
include stopping the LAr circulation pumps (to reduce the heat 
ingress to the cryostat), increasing the argon flow rate through 
the recondenser, increasing the LN$_2$ flow through the recondenser vessel, 
powering down heat sources within the cryostat (e.g., detector electronics).  
Eventually, if the pressure continues to rise, it will trigger the 
pressure-relief valves to operate. Table~\ref{table:pressure-values} 
gives important pressure values.

%%%%%%%%%
\begin{table}
\centering
%\begin{tabular}[htbp]{| p{0.3\textwidth}|p{0.3\textwidth}||p{0.3\textwidth}|}
\caption{Important Pressure Values}
\label{table:pressure-values}\begin{tabular}[htbp]{|l|l|}
\hline 
Vessel ullage maximum operating pressure & 0.121 MPa, 200 mbarg, 2.9 psig\\
\hline
Relief valve set pressure& 0.135 MPa, 350 mbarg, 5.1 psig\\
\hline
Roof truss design working pressure& 0.135 MPa, 350 mbarg, 5.1 psig\\
\hline
\end{tabular} 

\end{table}
%%%%%%%%%

The ability of the control system to maintain a set pressure is 
dependent on the size of pressure upsets (due to changes in flow, 
heat load, temperature, atmospheric pressure, etc.) and the volume 
of gas in the system.  The reference design has 0.66 m 
of gas at the top of the cryostat.  This is 5\% of the total 
argon volume and is the typical vapor fraction used for cryogenic 
storage vessels. Reaction time to changes in the heat load is slow, 
on the order of an hour.  At the expected heat-load rate of 
69.9~kW, and for an isolated or un-cooled cryostat,
the rate of pressure rise would be 393~mbar (5.7 psi) per hour. 
We plan to provide two redundant pressure control valves to maintain the required pressure range, each sized to handle at least 1300 kg/hr of argon flow to the recondenser to handle the cooling and
reliquefaction of warm GAr during cryostat filling.


\subsection{Overpressure Control}

In addition to the normal-operation pressure-control system, 
it is planned to provide a cryostat overpressure-protection 
system. This must be a high-integrity, automatic, failsafe
system capable of preventing catastrophic structural failure
of the cryostat in the case of excessive internal pressure.

The key active components of the planned system are pressure-relief 
valves (PRVs) located on the roof of the cryostat that will open rapidly when the differential pressure exceeds a 
preset value. A pressure-sensing line is used to trigger a pilot 
valve which in turn opens the PRV. A pressurized reservoir of 
power fluid is provided to each valve to ensure that the valves 
will operate under all upset and/or shutdown scenarios. The PRVs 
are self-contained devices provided specially for tank protection; 
they are not normally part of the control system. 

The installation of the PRVs will ensure that each valve can 
periodically be isolated and tested for correct operation.  
The valves must be removable from service for maintenance 
or replacement without impacting the overall containment envelope 
of the cryostat or the integrity of the over-pressure protection 
system.  This normally requires the inclusion of isolation valves 
upstream and downstream of the pressure-relief valves and at least
one spare installed relief valve ($n+1$ provision).

When the valves open, argon is released, the pressure within the 
cryostat falls and argon gas discharges into the argon vent riser.  
The valves are designed to close when the pressure returns below 
the preset level.

\subsection{Vacuum-Relief System}

The cryostat vacuum-relief system is a high-integrity, 
automatic, failsafe system designed to prevent catastrophic 
structural failure of the cryostat due to low internal pressure.  
The vacuum-relief system protects the primary membrane tank. 
Activation of this system is a non-routine operation and is 
not anticipated to occur during the life of the cryostat. 

%Theoretically, 
Potential causes of reduced pressure in the cryostat include 
operation of discharge pumps while the liquid-return inlet 
valves are shut, gaseous argon condensing in the recondenser 
(a thermo-siphon effect), or a failure of the vent system 
when draining the cryostat. Vacuum-relief valves are provided 
on LNG/LPG storage tanks to protect the structure from these 
types of events.  


%A vacuum relief system will be provided in addition to the normal pressure-control system.   
The key active components of this additional protection system 
are vacuum-relief valves located on the roof of the cryostat 
that will monitor the differential pressure between the inside 
and the outside of the cryostat and open when the differential 
pressure exceeds a preset value, allowing cavern air to enter 
the cryostat to restore a safe pressure. 

\section{LN$_2$ Refrigeration System}
\label{sec:ln-refrig-sys}
%BN modified refrigeration size 10/6/2011
Four commercial LN$_2$-refrigeration plants will be procured for LBNF.  
After achieving the required purity and completing initial fill, each 
cryostat will have a dedicated LN$_2$ plant for steady-state operations.
The plants will be located in the central utility cavern at the 
4850L. Each will be a closed-loop system supplying LN$_2$
to the argon recondenser. The nominal rating of the quoted
refrigerators is in the range of 65 kW.

Two-phase nitrogen is delivered from the cold end of the refrigerator 
into a farm of  LN$_2$ storage vessels with a total capacity of 50 m$^3$ per cryostat. 
Pure liquid is withdrawn from the LN$_2$ storage vessels and is supplied 
via transfer line to a pressure-reducing valve and phase-separator tank 
also located within the central utility cavern. LN$_2$ is then withdrawn from the bottom 
of the phase-separator tank, at a pressure of 2.0 bar and temperature of 
84 K, and directed to the recondenser. This results in a 5 K temperature 
difference relative to the 89 K argon recondenser temperature. The 
six 8.3 m$^3$ LN$_2$ vessels will allow for greater than forty hours 
of refrigeration time. This time window is adequate to cover most power 
outages, refrigerator performance problems and refrigerator switch-overs.

The refrigeration system operation, illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:LN2-refrigerator-flow}, 
is based on a screw compressor package and three turbo expanders. 
This system is expected to be capable of running  
continuously for at least a year, and then require only 
minor servicing. The system will be equipped with 
automatic controls and a remote monitoring so that no operator 
will be required during normal operation. 
Estimated maximum power requirement is 1500 hp, 
not taking into account the power generated by the expanders.  
The LBNF reference design places the nitrogen compressor in 
a surface-level equipment building. A closed-loop water system 
with evaporative-cooling tower removes heat from the compressor. 
Compression is carried out at close-to-ambient temperature. 
A compressor aftercooler is provided to reject heat. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.25\textwidth,angle=270]{nitrogen-refrig-plant-flow.png}
\caption{Nitrogen refrigeration-plant flow diagram}
\label{fig:LN2-refrigerator-flow}
\end{figure}

The fluid is next routed to a `cold box' consisting of four heat exchangers.  
This series of exchangers provides staged heat transfer from a cooling 
nitrogen stream to a warming one.  The expanders are connected between 
the heat exchangers to progressively reduce the pressure of the cooling 
nitrogen stream to isentropically reduce the pressure and temperature of the
nitrogen stream, eventually leading to a large liquid-nitrogen fraction 
at the coldest end of the cold box. 

The main cold box shell is 1.22~m (4~ft) in diameter and 8.2~m (27~ft) tall, 
as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:nitrogren-refrigerator}. The expanders 
are adjacent to the cold box at three elevations and extend about 1~m to
the side of the cold box shell. The reference design cold box weighs 5670~kg. The 
compressors are located at the surface inside an equipment building. 
The compressor skid (frame) is 4.3~m long, 1.8~m wide and 2.7~m tall 
and weighs approximately 3630~kg.

\section{Refrigeration Load Scenarios}
\label{sec:refrigeration-load-scenarios}

%\begin{editornote}
%Editor's Note:  The load scenario information contained in this section 
%is relevant for a 34-kton fiducial mass detector made up of two 17-kton 
%modules.  As of late 2014, the refrigerator will need to serve the first 
%10-kton detector cavern and the 30-kt detector cavern.
%\end{editornote}

In order to determine the optimal plant capacity and number of plants 
required, we forecast the LN$_2$ refrigeration loads and plant capacity
needed over fourteen scenarios.  Those scenarios are described below and 
a summary is given in Table~\ref{table:Refrigeration-loads}. 
                          
The conclusion points to the requirement of four 65 kW plants. Each of 
these plants can achieve a 20\% turn up or turn down. Scenarios 1, 4, A and D 
impose the most severe requirements. In these scenarios, all four plants 
will be required to operate at a duty cycle of approximately 85\%. These 
scenarios include one (two or three) completely filled and purified 
cryostat (s) and another one being purified and requiring frequent 
filter regeneration.

\begin{description}
\item[Scenario 1]
The initial operation will be the purging, cooling and filling of the 
first cryostat, condensing gaseous argon in the cavern by heat exchange 
via the recondensers. The surface and cavern LAr and  LN$_2$ dewars 
will be operational and the cooling load for the dewars will come 
directly from the refrigeration plant. The cavern pipework and vessels 
will be cold, the LAr in the cryostat will be circulating at high flow 
rate through the purification plant, and the cryostat will be cold.
The cryostat cool-down rate is constrained by three variables: 1) The 
size of the piping from the surface to bottom of Ross shaft, 2) The 
size of the LN$_2$ refrigeration units, and 3) the cooling power 
available via the recondensers.  All three variables have been 
matched for the physical constraints of a 40 kton module at 4850L 
using the Ross shaft. The refrigerators and condensers have been 
sized to accommodate the long-term refrigeration load associated 
with the cryostats.  As the LAr is circulated to achieve the 
operational purity the filtration plant will need to be regularly 
regenerated. This will mean that the associated refrigeration 
load will normally be present.

\item[Scenario 2]
Once the first cryostat is filled with LAr, the cool-down load will 
reduce to zero and the cryogenic plant will run for several months 
purifying the LAr inventory.

\item[Scenario 3]
When the LAr in the cryostat reaches the required purity level, the 
circulation flow rate will be reduced and the detector electronics 
will be turned on.  At this stage the recondenser refrigeration 
load falls such that only one recondenser is required and the 
rest of units can operate as spare units.

\item[Scenario 4] The first cryostat continues to operate in normal
experimental mode 
%and 
while  the second cryostat is being purged, cooled down and 
filled with LAr. Again a very large burden is placed on the 
recondensers due to the gas condensation and rate of liquefaction.

\item[Scenario 5] The second cryostat is full and LAr is circulated 
at high flow rate through the purification plant. The first cryostat
continues to operate as normally.

\item[Scenario 6]
Both cryostats are operating in normal experimental mode. A spare 
recondenser is available on each cryostat to facilitate maintenance.

\item[Scenario 7]
It is assumed that a total failure of the refrigeration plant has 
occurred. All noncritical heat sources are isolated and liquid 
nitrogen from the LN$_2$ vessels in the central utility cavern 
is utilized to recondense the inventory of high purity LAr. Nitrogen 
refrigeration must be reestablished before the liquid nitrogen reservoir 
is exhausted or the high purity argon will need to be vented. In the 
locked-down state, the recirculation pumps and the purification 
plants are shut down.

\item[Scenario A]
The first and second cryostats continue to operate in normal
experimental mode while  the third cryostat is being purged, 
cooled down and filled with LAr. Again a very large burden 
is placed on the recondensers due to the gas condensation 
and rate of liquefaction.

\item[Scenario B]
The third cryostat is full and LAr is circulated at high 
flow rate through the purification plant. The first and 
second cryostats continue to operate as normally.

\item[Scenario C]
Three cryostats are operating in normal experimental mode. A spare 
recondenser is available on each cryostat to facilitate maintenance.

\item[Scenario D]
The three cryostats continue to operate in normal experimental
mode while the fourth cryostat is being purged, cooled down 
and filled with LAr. Again a very large burden is placed 
on the recondensers due to the gas condensation 
and rate of liquefaction.

\item[Scenario E]
The fourth cryostat is full and LAr is circulated at high 
flow rate through the purification plant. The three cryostats 
previously filled continue to operate as normally.

\item[Scenario F]
All four cryostats are operating in normal experimental mode. A spare 
recondenser is available on each cryostat to facilitate maintenance.

\item[Scenario G]
This is the same condition as Scenario 7, but now all four cryostats
are in the LAr inventory protection mode.

\chapter{Prototyping Plans}
\label{sec:cryo-cryosys-proto-plans}

%\begin{editornote}
%Editor's Note: LAPD has successfully achieved greater than 5 millisecond 
%electron lifetime, and the LBNE 35 t has also achieved greater than 
%2.5 milli-second electron lifetime. 
%\end{editornote}

The development of the LBNF cryogenics infrastructure from conceptual 
to preliminary design includes a prototyping program. The most 
significant issue to resolve is whether a membrane cryostat in
the size of LBNF can achieve the required electron-drift lifetime. 
There was the Liquid Argon Purity Demonstrator (LAPD), an 
off-project prototype built as part of an R\&D program at 
Fermilab to study the scaling of LAr cryostat to kton
level. The purge process accomplished in the LAPD was 
repeated on the 35 ton membrane-cryostat prototype 
developed as an LBNE effort, which confirmed that initial 
evacuation of the cryostat is unnecessary and that 
a LAr purity level sufficient to enable the required 
drift times in a membrane cryostat can be achieved 
among other requirements~cite{Montanari:2013/06/13aqa}.

\chapter{ES\&H}
\label{sec:cryo-cryosys-esh}

During all phases of LBNF and the proposed prototypes, Fermilab ES\&H standards and
Sanford Laboratory ES\&H codes and standards will guide the design, procurement and
installation phases of the project. Particular attention will be paid to critical sections of
Chapter 5000~\cite{feshm} relating to ODH, standards for piping construction and vessel design. The
planned work process will provide for reviews throughout all phases of the project to guarantee
stringent adherence to the safety requirements. Requirements on the membrane-cryostat
materials and their fabrication will be strictly outlined in the specification documents. Close
communication between the vendors, Fermilab's cryogenic and process engineers, and Fermilab and Sanford Laboratory ES\&H personnel will be maintained at all times.
