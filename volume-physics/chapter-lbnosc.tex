% {\bf [Note: Copied from Section 2.2 of the LBNE Science Document.]}  
The Standard Model of particle physics 
presents a remarkably accurate
description of the elementary particles and their
interactions. However, its limitations beg deeper questions about
Nature. The unexplained patterns of quarks, leptons, flavors and
generations imply that a more fundamental underlying theory must
exist.  
DUNE plans to pursue a detailed
study of neutrino mixing, resolve the neutrino mass ordering,
and search for CP violation in the lepton sector by
studying the oscillation patterns of high-intensity
$\nu_\mu$ and $\overline{\nu}_\mu$ beams measured over a long baseline. 
Neutrino oscillation arises from mixing between the flavor and mass eigenstates of neutrinos,
corresponding to the weak and gravitational interactions, respectively. 
This three-flavor-mixing
scenario can be described by a rotation between the weak-interaction
eigenstate basis $(\nu_e,\, \nu_\mu,\, \nu_\tau)$ and the basis of
states of definite mass $(\nu_1,\, \nu_2,\, \nu_3)$.  In direct
correspondence with mixing in the quark sector, the transformations
between basis states is expressed in the form of a complex unitary
matrix, known as the PMNS matrix :
\begin{equation}
\left(\begin{array}{ccc} \nu_e \\ \nu_\mu \\ \nu_\tau \end{array} \right)= 
\underbrace{
  \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
      U_{e 1} &  U_{e 2} & U_{e 3} \\ 
      U_{\mu1} &  U_{\mu2} & U_{\mu 3} \\ 
      U_{\tau 1} &  U_{\tau 2} & U_{\tau 3} 
    \end{array} \right)
}_{U_{\rm PMNS}} \left(\begin{array}{ccc} \nu_1 \\ \nu_2 \\ \nu_3 \end{array} \right).
\label{eqn:pmns0}
\end{equation}
The PMNS matrix in full generality depends on just three mixing angles
and a CP-violating phase.  The mixing angles and phase are designated
as $(\theta_{12},\, \theta_{23},\, \theta_{13})$ and
\deltacp.  %\fixme{mathmatical rep of mixing}
This matrix can be parameterized as the product of three
two-flavor mixing matrices as follows, where $c_{\alpha \beta}=\cos \theta_{\alpha \beta}$ and $s_{\alpha
  \beta}=\sin \theta_{\alpha \beta}$:

\begin{equation}
U_{\rm PMNS} = 
  \underbrace{
    \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
        1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
        0 & c_{23} & s_{23} \\ 
        0 & -s_{23} & c_{23}
    \end{array} \right)
  }_{\rm I}
\underbrace{
  \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
      c_{13} & 0 & e^{i\delta_{cp}}s_{13} \\ 
      0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
      -e^{i\delta_{cp}}s_{13} & 0 & c_{13}
  \end{array} \right) 
}_{\rm II}
\underbrace{
 \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
      c_{12} & s_{12} & 0 \\ 
      -s_{12} & c_{12} & 0 \\ 
      0 & 0 & 1
  \end{array} \right) 
}_{\rm III}
\label{eqn:pmns}
\end{equation}
The parameters of the PMNS
matrix determine the probability amplitudes of the neutrino
oscillation phenomena that arise from mixing.  The frequency of neutrino oscillation 
depends on the difference in the squares of the neutrino
masses, $\Delta m^{2}_{ij} \equiv m^{2}_{i} - m^{2}_{j}$; a set of three
neutrino mass states implies two independent mass-squared differences
($\Delta m^{2}_{21}$ and $\Delta m^{2}_{32}$). The ordering of the
mass states is known as the \emph{neutrino mass hierarchy}. An ordering of
$m_1 < m_2 < m_3$ is known as the \emph{normal hierarchy} since it matches
the ordering of the quarks in the Standard Model, whereas an ordering of $m_3 < m_1 < m_2$
is referred to as the \emph{inverted hierarchy}.

The entire complement of neutrino experiments to date has measured
five of the mixing parameters: the three angles $\theta_{12}$,
$\theta_{23}$ and (recently) $\theta_{13}$, and the two mass differences
$\Delta m^{2}_{21}$ and $\Delta m^{2}_{32}$. The sign of $\Delta
m^{2}_{21}$ is known, but not that of $\Delta m^{2}_{32}$, which 
is the crux of the 
mass hierarchy ambiguity.
The values of $\theta_{12}$ and $\theta_{23}$ are large, while 
$\theta_{13}$ is smaller~\cite{An:2013zwz}. The value of \deltacp is unknown.
The real values of the entries of the PMNS mixing matrix, which
contains information on the strength of flavor-changing weak decays in
the lepton sector, can be expressed in approximate form as

\begin{equation}
|U_{\rm PMNS}|\sim \left(\begin{array}{ccc} 0.8 & 0.5 & 0.2 \\ 0.5 & 0.6 & 0.6 \\ 0.2 & 0.6 & 0.8\end{array} \right).
\label{eq:pmnsmatrix}
\end{equation}

%\fixme{math rep of comparison of nu to Q}

The three-flavor-mixing scenario for neutrinos is now well
established. However, the mixing parameters are not known to the same precision 
as are those in the
corresponding quark sector, and several important quantities, including
the value of \deltacp and the sign of the large mass splitting, are
still undetermined. In addition, several recent
anomalous experimental results count among their possible
interpretations phenomena that do not fit this 
model~\cite{Aguilar:2001ty,AguilarArevalo:2007it,Aguilar-Arevalo:2013pmq,Mention:2011rk}.

The relationships between the values of the parameters in the neutrino
and quark sectors suggest that mixing in the two sectors is
qualitatively different. Illustrating this difference, the value of
the entries of the CKM quark-mixing matrix (analogous to the PMNS matrix for
neutrinos, and thus indicative of the strength of flavor-changing weak
decays in the quark sector) can be expressed in approximate form as
\begin{equation}
|V_{\rm CKM}|\sim \left(\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0.2 & 0.004\\ 0.2 & 1 & 0.04 \\ 0.008 & 0.04 & 1\end{array} \right)
\label{eq:ckmmatrix}
\end{equation}
and compared to the entries of the PMNS matrix given in Equation~\ref{eq:pmnsmatrix}.
As discussed in \cite{King:2014nza}, the question of why the quark mixing angles are
smaller than the lepton mixing angles is an important part of the ``flavor problem.''

Quoting the discussion in~\cite{deGouvea:2013onf}, ``while the CKM
matrix is almost proportional to the identity matrix plus
hierarchically ordered off-diagonal elements, the PMNS matrix is far
from diagonal and, with the possible exception of the $U_{e3}$
element, all elements are ${\cal O}(1)$.''
One theoretical method often used to address this question involves the use of non-Abelian discrete
subgroups of $SU(3)$ as flavor symmetries; the popularity of this method comes partially from
the fact that these symmetries can give rise to the nearly \emph{tri-bi-maximal}\footnote{Tri-bi-maximal mixing refers to a form of the neutrino mixing matrix with effective bimaximal mixing of $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$
at the atmospheric scale ($L/E \sim$ \SI{500}{\km / \GeV}) and effective trimaximal
mixing for $\nu_e$ with $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$ 
at the solar scale ($L/E \sim$ \SI{15000}{\km / \GeV})~\cite{Harrison:2002er}.} 
structure of the PMNS matrix.
Whether employing these flavor symmetries or other methods,
any theoretical principle that attempts to describe the fundamental
symmetries implied by the observed organization of quark and neutrino
mixing --- such as those proposed in unification models --- leads to
testable predictions such as sum rules between CKM and PMNS
parameters~\cite{King:2014nza,deGouvea:2013onf,Mohapatra:2005wg,Albright:2006cw}.
Data on the patterns of neutrino mixing 
are already proving crucial in the quest for a 
relationship between quarks and leptons and their seemingly arbitrary generation
structure.  

Clearly much work remains in order to complete the standard three-flavor 
mixing picture, particularly 
with regard to $\theta_{23}$ (is it less than, greater than, or equal
to $45^\circ$?), mass hierarchy (normal or inverted?) 
and \deltacp.
Additionally, there is 
great value in obtaining a set of measurements for multiple parameters 
\emph{from a single experiment}, so that correlations and systematic 
uncertainties can be handled properly.  Such an experiment would also be 
well positioned to extensively test the standard picture of three-flavor mixing.  
DUNE is designed to be this experiment.

\section{Expected Event Rate and Sensitivity Calculations}
\label{sec:physics-lbnosc-senscalc}

The oscillation probability of \numu $\rightarrow$ \nue through matter, 
to first order, in a constant density
approximation is~\cite{Nunokawa:2007qh}:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:oscprob}
P(\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e) & \simeq & \sin^2 \theta_{23} \sin^2 2 \theta_{13} 
\frac{ \sin^2(\Delta_{31} - aL)}{(\Delta_{31}-aL)^2} \Delta_{31}^2\\ \nonumber
& & + \sin 2 \theta_{23} \sin 2 \theta_{13} \sin 2 \theta_{12} \frac{ \sin(\Delta_{31} - aL)}{(\Delta_{31}-aL)} \Delta_{31} \frac{\sin(aL)}{(aL)} \Delta_{21} \cos (\Delta_{31} + \delta_{CP})\\ \nonumber
& & + \cos^2 \theta_{23} \sin^2 2 \theta_{12} \frac {\sin^2(aL)}{(aL)^2} \Delta_{21}^2, \\ \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
%
where 
  \[ \Delta_{ij} = \Delta m^2_{ij} L/4E,\ {\rm and} \ a=G_F N_e /\sqrt{2}. \]
%
In the above, both \deltacp and $a$ 
switch signs in going from the
$\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ to the $\overline{\nu}_\mu \to \overline{\nu}_e$ channel; i.e.,
a neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry is introduced both by the CP-violating
phase, \deltacp, and the matter effect, the origin of which 
is simply the presence of electrons and absence of positrons in the Earth.  
The asymmetry from the matter effect increases with baseline as the neutrinos
pass through more matter, so an experiment with a longer baseline will be
more sensitive to the neutrino mass hierarchy. For baselines longer than 
$\sim$1200~km {\bf [Note: Can we provide a reference?]}, the degeneracy between the asymmetries from matter
and CP-violation effects can be resolved, so DUNE, with a baseline of 1300~km, 
will be able to unambiguously
determine the neutrino mass hierachy and measure the value of \deltacp in the same experiment.

The electron neutrino appearance probability, $P(\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e)$, 
is shown in 
Figure \ref{fig:oscprob} 
at a baseline of 1300~km as a function of neutrino 
energy for several values of \deltacp. As this figure illustrates, the value 
of \deltacp affects both the amplitude and frequency of
the oscillation. The difference in probability amplitude
for differing values of \deltacp is larger at higher oscillation nodes, which 
correspond to energies less than 1.5~GeV. Therefore, a broadband experiment, 
capable of measuring not only the rate of \nue appearance but of mapping out the 
spectrum of observed oscillations down to energies of at least 500~MeV, 
is desirable. Since there are terms proportional to $\sin\delta_{cp}$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:oscprob},
changes to the value of \deltacp induce opposite changes to \nue and
\anue appearance probabilities, so a beam that is capable of operating in
neutrino (forward horn current) and antineutrino (reverse horn current)
is also a critical component of the experiment.

  (right), for normal hierarchy. The yellow line indicates the oscillation
  probability if $\theta_{13}$ were equal to zero.}

The experimental sensitivities presented here are estimated using 
GLoBES\cite{Huber:2004ka,Huber:2007ji}. GLoBES takes flux simulation, cross-sections,
and detector-response parameterization as inputs. In this document we present
a range of possible experimental performance that depends on the design of the neutrino beam.
A conservative estimate of sensitivity is calculated using a flux simulation that is based on the reference design of the beam line as presented in \vollbnf.  A flux simulation based on an optimized beam design is used to show the goal sensitivity.  There are a range of design options that produce sensitivities in between the sensitivity of the reference beam design and optimized beam design. The actual flux will depend upon details of the hadron production and focusing design; optimization of the beam design to maximize experimental sensitivity is a critical aspect of the experiment
design.  Section~\ref{sec:physics-lbnosc-beam-req} describes the flux simulations used for the sensitivity estimates and explores the possible improvements that could be achieved by variations in the reference beam design.


The LAr TPC performance parameters that go into the GLoBES calculation are generated using a fast Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, described in detail in \cite{Adams:2013qkq}.  The MC uses flux simulations and the GENIE event generator \cite{Andreopoulos:2009rq} to generate neutrino interactions on argon.  Events can then be classified as $\nu_e$ CC-like or background-like based on event-level reconstructed quantities.   {\bf [Add more details of classification?]}
% The detector response assumed in these calculations
% is summarized in Table~\ref{tab:lar-nuosc-totaltable}. 
The energy smearing, signal efficiency, and misidentification rates for background vary with energy. {\bf [How to succinctly summarize energy-dependent quantities? Efficiency and resolution at first osc max?]} The neutrino oscillation
parameters and the uncertainty on those parameters are taken from the 
Nu-Fit\cite{Gonzalez-Garcia:2014bfa} global fit to neutrino data; the values are given in 
Table~\ref{tab:oscpar_nufit}.  The cross-section inputs to GLoBES have been generated using GENIE 2.8.4~\cite{Andreopoulos:2009rq}.

Sensitivity to determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy and discovery
of CP violation are obtained by
simultaneously fitting the $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_\mu$,
$\overline{\nu}_\mu \rightarrow \overline{\nu}_\mu$, $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e$, 
and  $\overline{\nu}_\mu \rightarrow \overline{\nu}_e$ oscillated spectra.  We assume 50\% of the total exposure comes in neutrino beam mode and 50\% in antineutrino beam mode.  Small deviations from a 1:1 ratio of neutrino to antineutrino data have been shown to have a minimal effect on the senstivity {\bf [Cite something?]}
An example of the \nue appearance and \numu disappearance spectra is shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:event_spec}.
The background to \nue appearance is composed of: i) intrinsic \nue and \anue 
from the beam; ii) mis-identified \numu and \anumu CC events; 
iii) neutral current (NC) backgrounds; iv) $\nu_\tau$ and $\bar{\nu}_\tau$ CC events 
in which the $\tau$'s decay leptonically into electrons/positrons. NC and $\nu_\tau$ 
backgrounds are due to interactions of higher energy neutrinos but they contribute to 
backgrounds mainly at low energy, which is important for the sensitivity to CP violation. 
Compared to the number of events shown in Figure {\bf xx}, an optimization of the beam, 
reducing the high energy tail of the flux, will help in significantly reducing this 
background. 
% As shown in \cite{::2013kaa}, $\nu_\tau$ interactions 
% have a different energy-missing 
% momentum distribution compared to the signal events and with appropriate cuts, which have
% not yet been included in this analysis, this background can be significantly reduced. {\bf(More on reduction of tau background? plots?)}

The neutrino oscillation parameters are all
allowed to vary, constrained by a Gaussian prior with 1$\sigma$ width given
by the relative uncertainties shown in Table~\ref{tab:oscpar_nufit}.
The effect of systematic uncertainty
is approximated using signal and background normalization uncertainties, which
are treated as 100\% uncorrelated among the four samples.
% Unless otherwise stated, the goal uncertainties of 1\% on signal normalization 
% and 5\% on background normalization for the \nue and \anue
% appearance measurements, in conjunction with uncorrelated
% 5\% signal and 10\% background normalization uncertainties in the \numu and
% \anumu disappearance measurements, are used to calculate the sensitivities.
The baseline systematic uncertainty estimates and the effect
of considering larger signal and background normalization uncertainties are
discussed in Section~\ref{sec:physics-lbnosc-beamnd-req}. 

In these fits, experimental sensitivity is
quantified using a test statistic, $\Delta\chi^2$, which is calculated
by comparing the predicted spectra for alternate hypotheses.
These quantities are defined, differently for neutrino mass hierarchy
and CP violation sensitivity, to be:
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta\chi^2_{MH} & = & \chi^2_{IH} - \chi^2_{NH}\textrm{ (true normal hierarchy),}\\ 
\Delta\chi^2_{MH} & = & \chi^2_{NH} - \chi^2_{IH}\textrm{ (true inverted hierarchy),}\\
\Delta\chi^2_{CPV} & = & Min[\Delta\chi^2_{CP}(\delta_{CP}^{test}=0),\Delta\chi^2_{CP}(\delta_{CP}^{test}=\pi)]\textrm{, where} \\
\Delta\chi^2_{CP} & = & \chi^2_{\delta_{CP}^{test}} - \chi^2_{\delta_{CP}^{true}}. \\ \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Since the true value of $\delta_{CP}$ is unknown, a scan is  performed over
all possible values of $\delta_{CP}^{true}$. 
We define a ``typical experiment'' as one with the most probable data given a set of input parameters, 
i.e. in which no statistical fluctuations have been applied.
In this case, the predicted spectra and the true spectra are identical;
for the example of CP violation, $\chi^2_{\delta_{CP}^{true}}$ 
is identically zero and the $\Delta\chi^2_{CP}$ value for a typical experiment is given by 
$\chi^2_{\delta_{CP}^{test}}$.

\section{Mass Hierarchy}
\label{sec:physics-lbnosc-mh}

Physics of MH (very brief).

The value of the test statistic for a typical experiment,  
$\overline{\Delta\chi^2}$, is
representative of the mean or the most likely value of $\Delta\chi^2$ that 
would be obtained in an ensemble of experiments.
With the exception of Figure~\ref{fig:mhstats}, the sensitivity plots
in this document have been generated using this method.
However, to address the expected sensitivity of a future experiment
requires consideration of the effect of
statistical fluctuations and variations in systematics.  If the
experiment is repeated many times, a distribution of $\Delta\chi^2$
values will appear.  Studies in~\cite{Qian:2012zn,Blennow:2013oma}
show that, in the case of the mass hierarchy
determination, the $\Delta \chi^2$ metric
{\em does not} follow the commonly expected chi-squared
function for one degree of freedom, which has a mean of
$\overline{\Delta\chi^2}$ and can be interpreted using a Gaussian
distribution with a standard deviation of
$\sqrt{|\overline{\Delta\chi^2}|}$. Rather, these studies show that
when the observed counts in the experiment are large enough,
the distribution of $\Delta\chi^2$ used here approximately follows
a Gaussian distribution with a
mean and standard deviation of $\overline{\Delta\chi^2}$ and
$2\sqrt{|\overline{\Delta\chi^2}|}$, respectively. Figure {\bf [Like Fig 4 of LOI]}
shows the range of sensitivity to the neutrino mass hierarchy, 
for the nominal exposure of 257 kt-MW-years,
when statistical
fluctuations are included and the statistical power as a function of exposure
for 3$\sigma$ and 5$\sigma$ sensitivity.

\section{Neutrino Beam Requirements}
\section{Neutrino Beam Requirements}
\label{sec:physics-lbnosc-beam-req}
The LBNF neutrino facility, located at Fermilab, utilizes a conventional horn-focused neutrino beam produced from pion decay-in-flight. It will aim the beam of neutrinos toward
the DUNE far detector located 1,300 km away at the Sanford Underground Research Facility. The neutrino facility must be designed for $\ge 20$ years of operation in order to provide adequate exposure for the DUNE experiment. During its lifetime, the facility must be able to accomodate various target and focusing configurations to enable tunability 
in the neutrino energy spectrum, and must be suitable for upgraded targets and horns as technology improves and the primary proton beam power will increase. Such
flexibility is an essential requirement for a facility that will have to operate over multiple decades. The energy range of the neutrino beam must be adaptable, in order to address new questions in neutrino physics that may come up during such a long period.

The LBNF facility:
\begin{enumerate} 
\item shall generate a high intensity, wide-band neutrino beam, selectable for muon neutrinos or muon antineutrinos, and with low contamination of the wrong-sign component.
\item the neutrino beam shall fully cover the energy range of the first oscillation node at $\sim 2.4$ GeV for a distance of 1,300 km, thus extending in energy from $\sim 5$ down to $\sim 1$ GeV. It shall also provide a neutrino flux as high as reasonably achievable around the second oscillation node at $\sim 0.8$ GeV, possibly requiring a dedicated focusing system configuration. Such energy range, extending from 0.5 to 5 GeV, is necessary to provide the maximum sensitivity for CP violation searches and the determination of the ordering of the neutrino masses. Focusing configurations providing neutrino energies higher than 5 GeV may still be required for a full exploration of the three-neutrino paradigm and to address anomalies that may arise during a time period of at least two decades. 
\item shall operate with $\geq 2$ MW primary proton beam at 120 GeV/c extracted from the Main Injector. It must be able to accept lower primary proton momenta down to 60 GeV/c, since this will provide some optimization in the tuning of the energy range of the neutrinos. More importantly, the capability to lower the energy of the protons is an effective way to reduce the wrong-sign component in the neutrino flux. A reduction of up to $\sim 15 \%$ in beam power is expected as the momentum of the primary protons decreases to 60 GeV/c, since the Main Injector cycle time does not scale linearly with the energy of the accelerated protons.
\item shall be built to provide a realistic estimation and whenever possible a reduction of the systematic errors on the knowledge of the neutrino flux, e. g. by adequate requirements on the alignment tolerances of the beamline components. Dedicated hadroproduction measurements from 60-120 GeV/c protons will be needed to reduce the uncertainty on the neutrino flux components, both from pion and kaon decays. 
\item shall be built to ensure the stability of the produced neutrino flux by minimizing the variations in targeting angle and position of the primary proton beam, short and long term displacement of the components of the focusing system, and variations in the current pulse to the horns.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Reference Beam Design}
\label{subsec:reference-design-focusing-system}
The reference beam design is described in detail in Volume 3. It includes a target similar to the one used for the low-energy tune of the NuMI beam~\cite{numitdr}, but of a larger thickness to accomodate the 1.2 MW primary proton beam, and focusing horns essentially identical to those currently in operation in the NuMI beamline~\cite{numitdr}. The target consists of 47 graphite segments, for a total length of the graphite core of 95 cm including the space between segments, corresponding to two interaction lengths. The upstream face of the first segment has to be positioned 45 cm upstream of the first focusing horn, to ensure sufficient clearance of the target downstream end from the horn inner conductor. The separation of the upstream faces of the two horns has been decreased to 6.6 m, compared to the 10 m distance for the low-energy tune of the NuMI beam, to slightly enhance the neutrino flux at lower energies. A helium-filled decay pipe, 4 m in diameter and 204 m in length, provides the decay volume for the secondary pions to decay to muon neutrinos. 

Neutrino fluxes for the reference beam are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:beam_req_reference_flux}.  By increasing the distance of the target from the first focusing horns, higher energy neutrino spectra can be produced, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:beam_req_lemehe}. The improvement in the neutrino fluxes for a longer decay pipe length of 250 m is also shown.

\subsection{Alternative Beam Options}
\label{subsec:alternative-focusing-systems}

There are several potential modifications to the reference beam design that would improve the experiment's sensitivity to the CP violating phase and mass hierarchy.
An option, which we will call enhanced reference beam, is still based on the NuMI focusing horn design, but includes a main upgrade to the lenght of the decay pipe, which is 
increased to 250 m, and a thinner and shorter cylindrical beryllium target positioned 25 cm upstream of the first focusing horn. The resulting neutrino flux, generated by an 80 GeV/c primary proton beam, with the horns operated at 230 kA current, is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:beam_req_focusing_comp}. A summary of the flux improvements associated with these modifications is available in Table~\ref{tab:beam_req_reference_options}.

\end{cdrtable} 
  
The option offering the largest gains in sensitivity is a redesign of the focusing system, including target and horns, which would require a modification of the dimensions
of the present target chase.  To identify optimal designs, a genetic algorithm was been implemented to search for beam configurations that maximize sensitivity to CP violation.
The procedure is inspired by a similar one developed by the LBNO collaboration , and considers 20 beamline parameters governing the primary proton energy, target dimensions, 
and horn shapes, positions and current. Figure~\ref{fig:beam_req_opthorn} shows the shape and the relative parameters used for the optimization of the first focusing horn, 
while the second focusing horn is modeled as a NuMI-style horn, but allowed to rescale both in radial and longitudinal dimensions. The procedure yields horn size and shapes 
similar to those found by the LBNO collaboration~\cite{LBNO}. The first focusing horn is $\sim 5.5$ m in length and $\sim 1.3$ m in diameter. It is important to note that this 
optimized beam configuration includes a second focusing horn that is 32\% longer and 7.8 m further downstream than that of the reference focusing design.  This option would 
require an increase both in lenght, by $\sim 9$ m, and in width, by $\sim 60$ cm, of the target chase in the reference design.  Such optimized beam, as shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:beam_req_focusing_comp}, produces a muon neutrino flux that is XX\% greater than the nominal configuration at the first oscillation maximum, 
XX\% greater at the second oscillation maximum, and reduces the antineutrino contamination of the beam. The optimized beam leads to improvements in sensitivity to both mass hierarchy 
and CP violation. Refinement of the optimization procedure, and evaluation of the feasibility of the optimized designs are in progress.

Figure~\ref{fig:beam_req_focusing_comp} shows a comparison of flux, signal rates, wrong sign background rates, and sensitivities to $\delta_{CP}$ in
the reference beam to the enhanced version of the reference design and to the optimized beam configuration.  The optimized focusing system substantially
increases flux in the 0.5-4 GeV region while decreasing wrong sign contamination.  Assuming an exposure of 150 MW-kton-yr, the net increase in 75\% $\delta_{CP}$ coverage 
over the reference design is 27\% ({\bf{to be updated with the latest estimates}}).  Although a mass hierarchy measurement was not explicitly optimized here, the optimized beam 
improves the minimum sensitivity to the mass hierarchy by 38\% ({\bf likewise}).
