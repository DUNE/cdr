% {\bf [Note: Copied from Section 2.2 of the LBNE Science Document.]}  
The Standard Model of particle physics 
presents a remarkably accurate
description of the elementary particles and their
interactions. However, its limitations pose deeper questions about
Nature. With the discovery of the Higgs boson at CERN, particle physics would be ``complete,'' except
for the issues associated with the neutrino sector, such as its unexplained flavor pattern.  These issues
imply that a more fundamental underlying theory must exist. 
DUNE plans to pursue a detailed
study of neutrino mixing, resolve the neutrino mass ordering,
and search for CP violation in the lepton sector by
studying the oscillation patterns of high-intensity
$\nu_\mu$ and $\overline{\nu}_\mu$ beams measured over a long baseline. 
Neutrino oscillation arises from mixing between the flavor $(\nu_e,\, \nu_\mu,\, \nu_\tau)$ and mass $(\nu_1,\, \nu_2,\, \nu_3)$
eigenstates of neutrinos.
% corresponding to the weak and gravitational interactions, respectively. 
% This three-flavor-mixing
% scenario can be described by a rotation between the weak-interaction
% eigenstate basis $(\nu_e,\, \nu_\mu,\, \nu_\tau)$ and the basis of
% states of definite mass $(\nu_1,\, \nu_2,\, \nu_3)$.  
In direct correspondence with mixing in the quark sector, the transformations
between basis states is expressed in the form of a complex unitary
matrix, known as the PMNS matrix :
\begin{equation}
\left(\begin{array}{ccc} \nu_e \\ \nu_\mu \\ \nu_\tau \end{array} \right)= 
\underbrace{
  \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
      U_{e 1} &  U_{e 2} & U_{e 3} \\ 
      U_{\mu1} &  U_{\mu2} & U_{\mu 3} \\ 
      U_{\tau 1} &  U_{\tau 2} & U_{\tau 3} 
    \end{array} \right)
}_{U_{\rm PMNS}} \left(\begin{array}{ccc} \nu_1 \\ \nu_2 \\ \nu_3 \end{array} \right).
\label{eqn:pmns0}
\end{equation}
The PMNS matrix in full generality depends on just three mixing angles
and a CP-violating phase\footnote{There are two additional CP phases (Majorana phases), but they are unobservable in the oscillation processes.}.  The mixing angles and phase are designated
as $(\theta_{12},\, \theta_{23},\, \theta_{13})$ and
\deltacp.
This matrix can be parameterized as the product of three
two-flavor mixing matrices as follows~\cite{Schechter:1980gr}, where $c_{\alpha \beta}=\cos \theta_{\alpha \beta}$ and $s_{\alpha
  \beta}=\sin \theta_{\alpha \beta}$:

\begin{equation}
U_{\rm PMNS} = 
  \underbrace{
    \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
        1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
        0 & c_{23} & s_{23} \\ 
        0 & -s_{23} & c_{23}
    \end{array} \right)
  }_{\rm I}
\underbrace{
  \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
      c_{13} & 0 & e^{-i\mdeltacp}s_{13} \\ 
      0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
      -e^{i\mdeltacp}s_{13} & 0 & c_{13}
  \end{array} \right) 
}_{\rm II}
\underbrace{
 \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
      c_{12} & s_{12} & 0 \\ 
      -s_{12} & c_{12} & 0 \\ 
      0 & 0 & 1
  \end{array} \right) 
}_{\rm III}
\label{eqn:pmns}
\end{equation}
The parameters of the PMNS
matrix determine the probability amplitudes of the neutrino
oscillation phenomena that arise from mixing.  The frequency of neutrino oscillation 
depends on the difference in the squares of the neutrino
masses, $\Delta m^{2}_{ij} \equiv m^{2}_{i} - m^{2}_{j}$; a set of three
neutrino mass states implies two independent mass-squared differences
(the ``solar'' mass splitting, $\Delta m^{2}_{21}$, and the ``atmospheric'' mass splitting, 
$\Delta m^{2}_{31}$), where $\Delta m^{2}_{31} = \Delta m^{2}_{32} + \Delta m^{2}_{21}$. The ordering of the
mass states is known as the \emph{neutrino mass hierarchy}. An ordering of
$m_1 < m_2 < m_3$ is known as the \emph{normal hierarchy} since it matches
the mass ordering of the charged leptons in the Standard Model, whereas an ordering of $m_3 < m_1 < m_2$
is referred to as the \emph{inverted hierarchy}.

The entire complement of neutrino experiments to date has measured
five of the mixing parameters~\cite{Gonzalez-Garcia:2014bfa}: the three angles $\theta_{12}$,
$\theta_{23}$ and (recently) $\theta_{13}$, and the two mass differences
$\Delta m^{2}_{21}$ and $\Delta m^{2}_{31}$. The sign of $\Delta
m^{2}_{21}$ is known, but not that of $\Delta m^{2}_{31}$, which 
is the crux of the 
mass hierarchy ambiguity.
The values of $\theta_{12}$ and $\theta_{23}$ are large, while 
$\theta_{13}$ is smaller. The value of \deltacp is unknown.
The absolute values of the entries of the PMNS mixing matrix, which
contains information on the strength of flavor-changing weak decays in
the lepton sector, can be expressed in approximate form as
\begin{equation}
|U_{\rm PMNS}|\sim \left(\begin{array}{ccc} 0.8 & 0.5 & 0.1 \\ 0.5 & 0.6 & 0.7 \\ 0.3 & 0.6 & 0.7\end{array} \right).
\label{eq:pmnsmatrix}
\end{equation}
using values for the mixing angles given in Table~\ref{tab:oscpar_nufit}.
The three-flavor-mixing scenario for neutrinos is now well
established. However, the mixing parameters are not known to the same precision 
as are those in the
corresponding quark sector, and several important quantities, including
the value of \deltacp and the sign of the large mass splitting, are
still undetermined. 

The relationships between the values of the parameters in the neutrino
and quark sectors suggest that mixing in the two sectors is
qualitatively different. Illustrating this difference, the value of
the entries of the CKM quark-mixing matrix (analogous to the PMNS matrix for
neutrinos, and thus indicative of the strength of flavor-changing weak
decays in the quark sector) can be expressed in approximate form as
\begin{equation}
|V_{\rm CKM}|\sim \left(\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0.2 & 0.004\\ 0.2 & 1 & 0.04 \\ 0.008 & 0.04 & 1\end{array} \right)
\label{eq:ckmmatrix}
\end{equation}
and compared to the entries of the PMNS matrix given in Equation~\ref{eq:pmnsmatrix}.
As discussed in \cite{King:2014nza}, the question of why the quark mixing angles are
smaller than the lepton mixing angles is an important part of the ``flavor problem.''

Quoting the discussion in~\cite{deGouvea:2013onf}, ``while the CKM
matrix is almost proportional to the identity matrix plus
hierarchically ordered off-diagonal elements, the PMNS matrix is far
from diagonal and, with the possible exception of the $U_{e3}$
element, all elements are ${\cal O}(1)$.''
A special role is played here by the fact that the magnitude of the smaller of the lepton
mixing angles is similar to the larger of the quark mixing parameters, namely the Cabbibo angle~\cite{Boucenna:2012xb}.
One theoretical method often used to address this question involves the use of non-Abelian discrete
subgroups of $SU(3)$ as flavor symmetries; the popularity of this method comes partially from
the fact that these symmetries can give rise to the nearly \emph{tri-bi-maximal}\footnote{Tri-bi-maximal mixing refers to a form of the neutrino mixing matrix with effective bimaximal mixing of $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$
at the atmospheric scale ($L/E \sim$ \SI{500}{\km / \GeV}) and effective trimaximal
mixing for $\nu_e$ with $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$ 
at the solar scale ($L/E \sim$ \SI{15000}{\km / \GeV})~\cite{Harrison:2002er}.} 
structure of the PMNS matrix.
Whether employing these flavor symmetries or other methods,
any theoretical principle that attempts to describe the fundamental
symmetries implied by the observed organization of quark and neutrino
mixing --- such as those proposed in unification models --- leads to
testable predictions such as sum rules between CKM and PMNS
parameters~\cite{King:2014nza,deGouvea:2013onf,Mohapatra:2005wg,Albright:2006cw}.
Data on the patterns of neutrino mixing 
are already proving crucial in the quest for a 
relationship between quarks and leptons and their seemingly arbitrary generation
structure.  

Clearly much work remains in order to complete the standard three-flavor 
mixing picture, particularly 
with regard to $\theta_{23}$ (is it less than, greater than, or equal
to $45^\circ$?), mass hierarchy (normal or inverted?) 
and \deltacp.
Additionally, there is 
great value in obtaining a set of measurements for multiple parameters 
\emph{from a single experiment}, so that correlations and systematic 
uncertainties can be handled properly.  Such an experiment would also be 
well positioned to extensively test the standard picture of three-flavor mixing.  
DUNE is designed to be this experiment.

\section{Expected Event Rate and Sensitivity Calculations}
\label{sec:physics-lbnosc-senscalc}

The oscillation probability of \numu $\rightarrow$ \nue through matter, 
to first order, in a constant density
approximation is~\cite{Nunokawa:2007qh}:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:oscprob}
P(\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e) & \simeq & \sin^2 \theta_{23} \sin^2 2 \theta_{13} 
\frac{ \sin^2(\Delta_{31} - aL)}{(\Delta_{31}-aL)^2} \Delta_{31}^2\\ \nonumber
& & + \sin 2 \theta_{23} \sin 2 \theta_{13} \sin 2 \theta_{12} \frac{ \sin(\Delta_{31} - aL)}{(\Delta_{31}-aL)} \Delta_{31} \frac{\sin(aL)}{(aL)} \Delta_{21} \cos (\Delta_{31} + \mdeltacp)\\ \nonumber
& & + \cos^2 \theta_{23} \sin^2 2 \theta_{12} \frac {\sin^2(aL)}{(aL)^2} \Delta_{21}^2, \\ \nonumber
\label{eqn:appprob}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Delta_{ij} = \Delta m^2_{ij} L/4E_\nu$, $a = G_FN_e/\sqrt{2}$, $G_F$ is the Fermi constant, $N_e$ is the number density of electrons in the Earth, $L$ is the baseline in km, and $E_\nu$ is the neutrino energy in GeV. 
In the equation above, both \deltacp and $a$ 
switch signs in going from the
$\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ to the $\overline{\nu}_\mu \to \overline{\nu}_e$ channel; i.e.,
a neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry is introduced both by CP violation (\deltacp)
and the matter effect ($a$). The origin of the matter effect asymmetry 
is simply the presence of electrons and absence of positrons in the Earth.  
In the few-GeV energy range, the asymmetry from the matter effect increases with baseline as the neutrinos
pass through more matter, so an experiment with a longer baseline will be
more sensitive to the neutrino mass hierarchy. For baselines longer than 
$\sim$1200~km, the degeneracy between the asymmetries from matter
and CP-violation effects can be resolved~\cite{Bass:2013vcg}, so DUNE, with a baseline of 1300~km, 
will be able to unambiguously
determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and measure the value of \deltacp in the same experiment.

The electron neutrino appearance probability, $P(\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e)$, 
is shown in 
Figure \ref{fig:oscprob} 
at a baseline of 1300~km as a function of neutrino 
energy for several values of \deltacp. As this figure illustrates, the value 
of \deltacp affects both the amplitude and frequency of
the oscillation. The difference in probability amplitude
for different values of \deltacp is larger at higher oscillation nodes, which 
correspond to energies less than 1.5~GeV. Therefore, a broadband experiment, 
capable of measuring not only the rate of \nue appearance but of mapping out the 
spectrum of observed oscillations down to energies of at least 500~MeV, 
is desirable. Since there are terms proportional to $\sin\mdeltacp$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:oscprob},
changes to the value of \deltacp induce opposite changes to \nue and
\anue appearance probabilities, so a beam that is capable of operating in
neutrino (forward horn current) and antineutrino (reverse horn current)
is also a critical component of the experiment.

  (right), for normal hierarchy. The yellow line indicates the oscillation
  probability if $\theta_{13}$ were equal to zero.}

The experimental sensitivities presented here are estimated using 
GLoBES\cite{Huber:2004ka,Huber:2007ji}. GLoBES takes flux simulations, cross-sections,
and detector-response parameterization as inputs. In this document we present
a range of possible physics sensitivity that depends on the design of the neutrino beam.
A conservative estimate of sensitivity is calculated using a flux simulation that is based on the reference design of the beam line as presented in \vollbnf.  A flux simulation based on an optimized beam design is used to show the goal sensitivity.  There are a range of design options that produce sensitivities in between the sensitivity of the reference beam design and optimized beam design, and further optimization is possible. The actual flux will depend upon details of the hadron production and focusing design; optimization of the beam design to maximize experimental sensitivity is a critical aspect of the experiment
design.  Table~\ref{tab:beamparam} summarizes some of the properties of the flux simulations used in the sensitivity studies.  The main differences between the two beam designs are the horn current, horn design, and decay pipe length; the choice of horn design has the biggest effect on the sensitivity. Section~\ref{sec:physics-lbnosc-beam-req} describes the flux simulations in more detail and explores the potential improvements that could be achieved by variations in the reference beam design.

The signal for \nue appearance is an excess of charged-current (CC) \nue and \anue interactions over the expected background in the far detector.  The background to \nue appearance is composed of: i) CC interactions of \nue and \anue intrinsic
to the beam; ii) mis-identified \numu and \anumu CC events; 
iii) neutral current (NC) backgrounds; iv) $\nu_\tau$ and $\bar{\nu}_\tau$ CC events 
in which the $\tau$'s decay leptonically into electrons/positrons. NC and $\nu_\tau$ 
backgrounds are due to interactions of higher energy neutrinos but they contribute to 
backgrounds mainly at low energy, which is important for the sensitivity to CP violation. 

The LAr TPC performance parameters that go into the GLoBES calculation are generated using the DUNE Fast Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, which is described in detail in \cite{Adams:2013qkq}.  The Fast MC combines the simulated flux, the GENIE neutrino interaction generator~\cite{Andreopoulos:2009rq}, and a parameterized detector response that is used to simulate the reconstructed energy and momentum of each final-state particle.  The simulated energy deposition of the particles in each interaction is then used to calculate reconstructed kinematic quantities (e.~g., the neutrino energy). Event sample classifications ($\nu_e$ CC-like, $\nu_{\mu}$ CC-like, or NC-like), including mis-ID rates, are determined by the identification of lepton candidates. Lepton candidates are selected based on a variety of criteria including on particle kinematics, detector thresholds, and probabilistic estimates of particle fates. To reduce the NC and $\nu_{\tau}$ CC backgrounds in the $\nu_e$ CC-like sample, an additional discriminant is formed using reconstructed transverse momentum along with reconstructed neutrino and hadronic energy as inputs to a k-Nearest-Neighbor (kNN) machine-learning algorithm.  Figures~\ref{fig:smearing_nue}-\ref{fig:smearing_nc} show the true-to-reconstructed energy smearing matrices extracted from the Fast MC and used as inputs to GLoBES.  Figure~\ref{fig:eff} shows the analysis sample detection$\times$selection efficiencies for the various signal and background modes used by GLoBES, also extracted from the Fast MC.

 The cross-section inputs to GLoBES have been generated using GENIE 2.8.4~\cite{Andreopoulos:2009rq}.
The neutrino oscillation parameters and the uncertainty on those parameters are taken from the 
Nu-Fit~\cite{Gonzalez-Garcia:2014bfa} global fit to neutrino data; the values are given in 
Table~\ref{tab:oscpar_nufit}.  (See also \cite{Capozzi:2013csa} and \cite{Forero:2014bxa} for other recent global fits.) Most of the sensitivities 
in this chapter are shown assuming normal hierarchy; this is an arbitrary choice for simplicity of presentation.

\begin{cdrtable}[Oscillation parameter values and relative uncertainties]{lcc}{oscpar_nufit}{Central value and relative uncertainty of neutrino oscillation parameters from a global fit~\cite{Gonzalez-Garcia:2014bfa} to neutrino oscillation data. Because the probability distributions are somewhat non-Gaussian (particularly for $\theta_{23}$), the relative uncertainty is computed using 1/6 of the 3$\sigma$ allowed range from the fit, rather than the 1$\sigma$ range.   For $\theta_{23}$ and $\Delta m^2_{31}$, the best-fit values and uncertainties depend on whether normal mass hierarchy (NH) or inverted mass hierarchy (IH) is assumed.}

Figures~\ref{fig:appspectra} and~\ref{fig:disspectra} 
show the expected event rate for \nue appearance and \numu disappearance, respectively, including
expected flux, cross-section, and oscillation probabilities as a function 
of neutrino energy at a baseline of 1300~km. The spectra are shown for a 150~kt-MW-yr exposure in both neutrino and antineutrino mode, for a total 300~kt-MW-yr exposure.  The optimized beam design results in an increased signal rate in the lower energy region. Tables~\ref{tab:apprates} and~\ref{tab:disrates} give the integrated rate between 0.5 and 8.0~GeV for the appearance and disappearance spectra, respectively.

Sensitivity to determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy and discovery
of CP violation are obtained by
simultaneously fitting the $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_\mu$,
$\overline{\nu}_\mu \rightarrow \overline{\nu}_\mu$, $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e$, 
and  $\overline{\nu}_\mu \rightarrow \overline{\nu}_e$ oscillated spectra.  We assume 50\% of the total exposure comes in neutrino beam mode and 50\% in antineutrino beam mode.  A 50\%/50\% ratio of neutrino to antineutrino data has been shown to produce a nearly optimal sensitivity, and small deviations from this (e.g., 40\%/60\%, 60\%/40\%) produce negligible changes in the sensitivity.

The neutrino oscillation parameters are all
allowed to vary, constrained by a Gaussian prior with 1$\sigma$ width given
by the relative uncertainties shown in Table~\ref{tab:oscpar_nufit}.
The effect of systematic uncertainty
is approximated using signal and background normalization uncertainties, which
are treated as 100\% uncorrelated among the four samples.
The baseline systematic uncertainty estimates and the effect
of considering larger signal and background normalization uncertainties are
discussed in Section~\ref{sec:physics-lbnosc-beamnd-req}. 

In these fits, experimental sensitivity is
quantified using a test statistic, $\Delta\chi^2$, which is calculated
by comparing the predicted spectra for alternate hypotheses.
These quantities are defined, differently for neutrino mass hierarchy
and CP violation sensitivity, to be:
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta\chi^2_{MH} & = & \chi^2_{IH} - \chi^2_{NH}\textrm{ (true normal hierarchy),}\label{eq:dx2_MH}\\ 
\Delta\chi^2_{MH} & = & \chi^2_{NH} - \chi^2_{IH}\textrm{ (true inverted hierarchy),}\\
\Delta\chi^2_{CPV} & = & Min[\Delta\chi^2_{CP}(\mdeltacp^{test}=0),\Delta\chi^2_{CP}(\mdeltacp^{test}=\pi)]\textrm{, where} \\
\Delta\chi^2_{CP} & = & \chi^2_{\mdeltacp^{test}} - \chi^2_{\mdeltacp^{true}}.\label{eq:dx2_CP} \\ \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Since the true value of $\mdeltacp$ is unknown, a scan is  performed over
all possible values of $\mdeltacp^{true}$. 
We define a ``typical experiment'' as one with the most probable data given a set of input parameters, 
i.e. in which no statistical fluctuations have been applied.
In this case, the predicted spectra and the true spectra are identical;
for the example of CP violation, $\chi^2_{\mdeltacp^{true}}$ 
is identically zero and the $\Delta\chi^2_{CP}$ value for a typical experiment is given by 
$\chi^2_{\mdeltacp^{test}}$.

\section{Mass Hierarchy}
\label{sec:physics-lbnosc-mh}

The 1300~km baseline establishes one of DUNE's key strengths: sensitivity to the matter
effect. This effect leads to a large asymmetry in the
$\nu_\mu\to \nu_e$ versus $\overline{\nu}_\mu \to \overline{\nu}_e$
oscillation probabilities, the sign of which depends on the mass
hierarchy (MH).  At 1300~km this asymmetry is approximately
$\pm 40\%$ in the region of the peak flux; this is larger than the
maximal possible CP-violating asymmetry associated with \deltacp,
meaning that both the MH and \deltacp can be
determined unambiguously with high confidence within the same
experiment using the beam neutrinos.  DUNE's goal is to determine the MH with a significance of at least $\sqrt{\overline{\Delta\chi^{2}}} = 5$ for all \deltacp values using beam neutrinos.  Concurrent analysis of the corresponding atmospheric-neutrino samples will improve the precision with which the
MH is resolved. 

Figure~\ref{fig:mh_nominal} shows the significance with which the MH can be determined as a function of the value of \deltacp, for an exposure of 300~kt-MW-yr, which corresponds to seven years of data (3.5 years in neutrino mode plus 3.5 years in antineutrino mode) with a 40-kt detector and a 1.07-MW beam.  For this exposure, the MH is determined with a minimum significance of $\sqrt{\overline{\Delta\chi^{2}}} = 5$ for 100\% of the \deltacp values for the optimized beam design and nearly 100\% of \deltacp values for the CDR reference beam design.  Figure~\ref{fig:mh_exposure} shows the significance with which the MH can be determined for 100\% of \deltacp values as a function of exposure.  Minimum exposures of approximately 400~kt-MW-yr and 250~kt-MW-yr are required to determine the MH with a significance of $\sqrt{\overline{\Delta\chi^2}} = 5$ for 100\% of \deltacp values for the CDR reference beam design and the optimized beam design, respectively.

The value of $\theta_{23}$ has the biggest impact on the sensitivity, and the least favorable scenario corresponds to a true value of \deltacp in which the MH asymmetry
is maximally offset by the leptonic CP asymmetry, and where, independently, 
$\sin^2{\theta_{23}}$ takes on a value at the low end of its 
experimentally allowed range.

Studies have indicated that special attention must be paid to the statistical interpretation of MH sensitivities~\cite{Qian:2012zn,Blennow:2013oma}.
In general, if an experiment is repeated many times, a distribution of $\Delta\chi^2$
values will appear due to statistical fluctuations.
It is usually assumed that the $\Delta \chi^2$ metric follows the expected chi-squared
function for one degree of freedom, which has a mean of
$\overline{\Delta\chi^2}$ and can be interpreted using a Gaussian
distribution with a standard deviation of
$\sqrt{|\overline{\Delta\chi^2}|}$.
In assessing the MH sensitivity of future experiments, it is common practice to generate
a simulated data set (for an assumed true MH) that does not include statistical fluctuations. 
In this typical case, $\overline{\Delta\chi^2}$ is reported as the expected sensitivity, 
where $\overline{\Delta\chi^2}$ is representative of the mean value of $\Delta\chi^2$ that 
would be obtained in an ensemble of experiments for a particular true MH.  
With the exception of Figure~\ref{fig:mhstats}, the sensitivity plots
in this document have been generated using this method.
However, studies in~\cite{Qian:2012zn,Blennow:2013oma}
show that, in the case of the mass hierarchy
determination, the $\Delta \chi^2$ metric {\em does not} follow the expected chi-squared
function for one degree of freedom.  Rather, these studies show that
when the observed counts in the experiment are large enough,
the distribution of $\Delta\chi^2$ used here approximately follows
a Gaussian distribution with a
mean and standard deviation of $\overline{\Delta\chi^2}$ and
$2\sqrt{|\overline{\Delta\chi^2}|}$, respectively. Because the distribution is atypical, the interpretation of 
test statistic values in terms of confidence intervals is different than the standard case.

The effect of statistical fluctuations in the MH measurement is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mhstats}.  The colored bands show
the possible range in the significance of a MH determination when statistical
fluctuations are included for a measurement that would yield a significance of $\sqrt{\overline{\Delta\chi^{2}}} = 5$
for 100\% of \deltacp values in our standard treatment (the solid blue line).  Also shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:mhstats} are horizontal lines that specify the confidence level of an experiment that measures a particular
value of $\sqrt{\Delta \chi^2}$, following the convention in~\cite{Qian:2012zn}. An experiment that measures
$\sqrt{\Delta \chi^2} = 5$ (black dashed line) has a $1 - 3.7\times10^{-6}$ probability of determining the
correct MH, while an experiment that measures$\sqrt{\Delta \chi^2} = 3$ (blue dashed line) has a 98.9\% 
probability of determining the correct MH. An experiment that measures $\sqrt{\Delta \chi^2} = 0$ (cyan dashed line)
has a 50\% probability of determining the correct MH.  In this case, both hypotheses (normal or inverted hierarchy) 
fit the data equally well, and the probability of guessing correctly is 50\%.

\begin{cdrfigure}[MH sensitivity including statistical fluctuations]{mhstats}{

The 40-kt DUNE far detector (FD) will be built in 10-kt modules, which will come online over the course of several years.  The near detector (ND) will likely start operations after FD operations are already ongoing.  Without any ND constraints, systematic uncertainties will be larger in the early stages of the experiment. Additionally, the beam power is expected to be upgraded from $\sim$1~MW to $\sim$2~MW during the course of the experiment. For a rough estimate of the sensitivity of DUNE as a function of real time for the first 10~years of operation, we consider the following staging plan:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Year 1: 10~kt FD mass; 1.07~MW beam power; No ND constraints (assume 5\% signal systematic)
 \item Year 2: Add second 10~kt FD module, for a total FD mass of 20~kt
 \item Year 3: Add third 10~kt FD module, for a total FD mass of 30~kt; Include constraints from preliminary ND data analysis (assume 3\% signal systematic)
 \item Year 4: Add fourth 10~kt FD module, for a total FD mass of 40~kt
 \item Year 5: Include constraints from a full ND data analysis (assume 2\% signal systematic)
 \item Year 7: Upgrade of beam power to 2.14~MW
\end{itemize}
We assume previous data sets can be reanalyzed with new assumptions, so each improvement in systematic uncertainty is applied to the full exposure up to that point.  Figure~\ref{fig:mh_staging} shows the MH sensitivity as a function of time considering this very preliminary staging plan.
%Add that integrated exposure is 535 kt-MW-yr after 10 years?

\section{CP-symmetry Violation}
\label{sec:physics-lbnosc-cpv}

In the particular parameterization of the PMNS matrix shown in
Equation~\ref{eqn:pmns}, the middle factor, labeled `II', describes
the mixing between the $\nu_1$ and $\nu_3$ mass states, and depends on
the CP-violating phase \deltacp.  With the recent measurement of $\theta_{13}$, we now know
that the conditions for measuring \deltacp in the three-flavor framework 
have been met; all three mixing angles are nonzero, and there are two distinct mass splittings.
In the approximation for the electron neutrino appearance probability given in Equation~\ref{eqn:appprob}, 
expanding the middle term results in the presence of CP-odd terms (dependant on $\sin \mdeltacp$) that have opposite signs 
in $\nu_{\mu} \rightarrow \nu_e$ and $\overline{\nu}_{\mu} \rightarrow \overline{\nu}_e$ oscillations.
For $\mdeltacp \neq 0$ or $\pi$, these terms introduce an
asymmetry in neutrino versus antineutrino oscillations. The magnitude of the
CP-violating terms in the oscillation depends most directly on the size of 
the Jarlskog Invariant~\cite{Jarlskog:1985cw}, a function that was
introduced to provide a measure of CP violation independent of the 
mixing-matrix parameterization. In terms of the parameterization presented in Equation~\ref{eqn:pmns},
the Jarlskog Invariant is:
%
\begin{equation}
J_{CP}^{\rm PMNS} \equiv \frac{1}{8} \sin 2 \theta_{12} \sin 2 \theta_{13}
\sin 2 \theta_{23} \cos \theta_{13} \sin \mdeltacp.
\end{equation}
The relatively large values of the mixing angles in the lepton sector imply that
leptonic CP-violation effects may be quite large ---  
depending on the value of the phase \deltacp, which is currently unknown. 
Experimentally, it is unconstrained at the 3$\sigma$ level by the global fit~\cite{Gonzalez-Garcia:2014bfa}.
Given the current best-fit values of the mixing angles~\cite{Gonzalez-Garcia:2014bfa} and assuming normal hierarchy,
\begin{equation}
J_{CP}^{\rm PMNS} \approx 0.03 \sin \mdeltacp.
\end{equation}
This is in sharp contrast to the very small mixing in the quark sector,  
which leads to a very small value of the corresponding quark-sector
Jarlskog Invariant~\cite{Beringer:1900zz},
\begin{equation}
J_{CP}^{\rm CKM} \approx 3 \times 10^{-5},
\end{equation}
despite the large value of $\delta^{\rm CKM}_{CP}\approx70^{\circ}$.

The variation in the $\nu_\mu \rightarrow
\nu_e$ oscillation probability (Equation~\ref{eqn:appprob}) with the value of \deltacp
indicates that it is experimentally possible to measure the value of
\deltacp at a fixed baseline using only the observed shape of the
$\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e$ {\em or} the 
$\overline{\nu}_\mu \rightarrow \overline{\nu}_e$
appearance signal measured over an energy range that encompasses at
least one full oscillation interval. A measurement of the value of
$\mdeltacp \neq 0 \ {\rm or} \ \pi$, assuming that neutrino mixing follows the three-flavor model, would imply CP violation.  

The CP asymmetry,
$\mathcal{A}_{CP}$, is defined as 
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:cp-asymm}
 \mathcal{A}_{CP} = \frac{P(\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e) -
  P(\overline{\nu}_\mu \rightarrow \overline{\nu}_e)}{P(\nu_\mu \rightarrow
  \nu_e) + P(\overline{\nu}_\mu \rightarrow \overline{\nu}_e)}.
\end{equation}
In the three-flavor model the asymmetry can be approximated to leading
order in $\Delta m_{21}^2$ as~\cite{Marciano:2006uc}:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{A}_{CP} \sim \frac{\cos \theta_{23} \sin 2 \theta_{12}
  {\sin \mdeltacp}}{\sin \theta_{23} \sin \theta_{13}}
\left(\frac{\Delta m^2_{21} L}{ 4 E_{\nu}}\right) + {\rm matter
  \ effects}
\label{eqn:cpasym}
\end{equation}
Regardless of the measured value obtained for \deltacp, the explicit observation
of the asymmetry $\mathcal{A}_{CP}$ in $\nu_{\mu} \rightarrow \nu_e$ and $\overline{\nu}_{\mu} \rightarrow \overline{\nu}_e$
oscillations is sought to directly demonstrate the
leptonic CP violation effect.  A measurement of \deltacp that is inconsistent with the measurement of $\mathcal{A}_{CP}$
according to Equation~\ref{eqn:cpasym} could be evidence of of physics beyond the standard three-flavor model.
For long-baseline experiments such as DUNE, where the neutrino beam propagates through 
the Earth's mantle, the leptonic CP-violation effects must be disentangled from 
the matter effects.

Figure~\ref{fig:cpv_nominal} shows the significance with which the CP violation ($\mdeltacp \neq 0 \ {\rm or} \ \pi$) can be determined as a function of the value of \deltacp for an exposure of 300~kt-MW-yr, which corresponds to seven years of data (3.5 years in neutrino mode plus 3.5 years in antineutrino mode) with a 40-kt detector and a 1.07-MW beam.  Figure~\ref{fig:cpv_exposure} shows the significance with which CP violation can be determined for 50\% or 75\% of \deltacp values as a function of exposure.  Table~\ref{tab:cpv_requiredexposure} lists the minimum exposure required to determine CP violation with a significance of 5$\sigma$ for 50\% of \deltacp values or 3$\sigma$ for 75\% of \deltacp values for both the CDR reference beam design and the optimized beam design.  The CP violation sensitivity as a function of \deltacp as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cpv_nominal} has a characteristic double peak structure because the significance of a CP violation measurement necessarily drops to zero where there is no CP violation: at the CP-conserving values of $-\pi,~0,~{\rm and}~\pi$.  Therefore, unlike the MH determination, it's not possible for any experiment to provide 100\% coverage in \deltacp for a CP violation measurement because CP violation effects vanish at certain values of \deltacp.

\section{Precision Oscillation Parameter Measurements}

% The value of \sinstt{23} is measured to be $>$~0.95 at 90\% CL 
% using atmospheric neutrino oscillations~\cite{Abe:2011ph}. 
The most precise measurement of $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ to date comes from T2K, $\sin^2\theta_{23}~=~0.514^{+0.055}_{-0.056}$~(normal hierarchy) and $\sin^2\theta_{23}~=~0.511~\pm~0.055$~(inverted hierarchy)~\cite{Abe:2015awa}.
This corresponds to a value of 
$\theta_{23}$ near 45\mbox{$^{\circ}$}, but leaves an ambiguity
as to whether the value of $\theta_{23}$ is in the lower octant 
(less than 45\mbox{$^{\circ}$}), the upper octant (greater than 45\mbox{$^{\circ}$}),
or exactly 45\mbox{$^{\circ}$}. 
The value of $\sin^2 \theta_{23}$ from
the global fit reported by~\cite{Gonzalez-Garcia:2014bfa} is $\sin ^2 \theta_{23} = 0.452
^{+0.052} _{-0.028} (1 \sigma)$ for normal hierarchy (NH), but the distribution of the $\chi^2$ from
the global fit has another local minimum --- particularly if the MH 
is inverted --- at $\sin^2 \theta_{23} = 0.579 ^{+0.025} _{-0.037} (1 \sigma)$. A
\emph{maximal} mixing value of $\sin^2 \theta_{23} =0.5$ is therefore still allowed
by the data and the octant is still largely undetermined.
A value of $\theta_{23}$ exactly equal to 45\mbox{$^{\circ}$} would indicate that 
$\nu_{\mu}$ and $\nu_{\tau}$ have equal contributions from $\nu_3$,
which could be evidence for a previously unknown symmetry. 
It is
therefore important experimentally to determine the value of
$\sin ^2 \theta_{23}$ 
with sufficient precision to determine 
the octant of $\theta_{23}$. 
The measurement of $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_\mu$ oscillations is
sensitive to $\sin ^2 2 \theta_{23}$, whereas the measurement of
$\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e$ oscillations is sensitive to $\sin^2
\theta_{23}$. 
A combination of both $\nu_e$ appearance and $\nu_\mu$ disappearance
measurements can probe both maximal mixing and the $\theta_{23}$
octant.  The $\Delta\chi^2$ metric is defined as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta\chi^2_{octant} & = & |\chi^2_{\theta_{23}^{test}>45^\circ} - \chi^2_{\theta_{23}^{test}<45^\circ}|, \\ \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where the value of $\theta_{23}$ in the \emph{wrong} octant is constrained 
only to have a value within the \emph{wrong} octant (i.e., it is not required
to have the same value of $\sin^22\theta_{23}$ as the true value).
Figure~\ref{fig:octant} shows the sensitivity to determining the octant as a function of $\theta_{23}$.  Figure~\ref{fig:res_th23} shows the resolution of $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ as a function of exposure, assuming the true value is $\sin^2\theta_{23} = 0.45$ from the current global fit.

As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:physics-lbnosc-cpv}, DUNE will seek not only to demonstrate explicit CP violation by observing a difference in the neutrino and antineutrino oscillation probabilities, but also to measure the value of the parameter \deltacp.  Figure~\ref{fig:res_cp} shows the resolution of \deltacp as a function of exposure for a CP-conserving value (\deltacp = 0) and the value that gives the maximum CP violation for normal MH (\deltacp = 90\mbox{$^{\circ}$}).

The shaded region represents the range in sensitivity due to potential variations in the beam design.  }
 \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{res_dcp_exp}
\end{cdrfigure}

The rich oscillation structure that can be observed by DUNE and the
excellent particle identification capability of the detector
will enable precision measurement  in a single experiment of all the mixing parameters
governing $\nu_1$-$\nu_3$ and $\nu_2$-$\nu_3$ mixing. Theoretical models probing quark-lepton
universality predict specific values of the mixing angles and the
relations between them. The
mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ is
expected to be measured accurately in reactor experiments by the end
of the decade with a precision that will be limited by
systematics. 
The combined statistical and systematic uncertainty on the value of $\sin ^ 2 2
\theta_{13}$ from the Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiment, which has
the lowest systematics, is currently $\sim6$\% ($\sin^22\theta_{13} = 0.084\pm0.005$),
with a projected uncertainty of $\sim$3\% by 2017~\cite{Zhang:2015fya}.
While the constraint on $\theta_{13}$ from the reactor experiments will be
important in the
early stages of DUNE for determining CP violation, measuring
\deltacp and determining the $\theta_{23}$ octant, 
DUNE itself will eventually be able to measure
$\theta_{13}$ independently with a similar precision to that expected from the reactor experiments. 
Whereas the reactor experiments measure $\theta_{13}$ using $\overline{\nu}_e$
disappearance, DUNE will measure it through $\nu_e$ and
$\overline{\nu}_e$ appearance, thus providing an independent constraint on
the three-flavor mixing matrix.   Figure~\ref{fig:res_th13} shows the resolution of $\sin^22\theta_{13}$ as a function of exposure, assuming the true value is $\sin^22\theta_{13} = 0.085$ from the current global fit.

\begin{cdrfigure}[Resolution of $\sin^22\theta_{13}$ as a function of exposure]{res_th13}{The resolution of a measurement of $\sin^22\theta_{13}$ as a function of exposure assuming normal MH and $\sin^22\theta_{13} = 0.085$ from the current global fit.

 \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{res_th13_exp}
\end{cdrfigure}

DUNE can also significantly improve the
resolution on the larger mass splitting beyond the precision of current experiments.  The current best fit value for $\Delta m^2_{32}$ from MINOS is $|\Delta m^2_{32}| = (2.34\pm0.09)\times10^{-3}$~eV$^2$ (normal hierarchy) and $|\Delta m^2_{32}| = (2.37^{+0.11}_{-0.07})\times10^{-3}$~eV$^2$ (inverted hierarchy)~\cite{Sousa:2015bxa}, with comparable precision acheived by both Daya Bay and T2K. The
precision on $\Delta m^2_{31}$ will ultimately depend on tight control
of energy-scale systematics.  Figure~\ref{fig:res_dm2} shows the expected resolution of \dm{31} as a function of exposure, assuming the true value is \dm{31} = $2.457\times10^{-3}$~eV$^2$ from the current global fit.

\section{Testing the 3-flavor Paradigm and the Standard Model}
\label{sec:physics-lbnosc-3nutests}

Due to the very small masses and large mixing of neutrinos, their oscillations over a long distance
  act as an exquisitely precise interferometer with high sensitivity to very small perturbations caused by 
  new physics phenomena, such as:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item nonstandard interactions in matter that manifest in
    long-baseline oscillations as deviations from the three-flavor mixing model
  \item new long-distance potentials arising from discrete symmetries
    that manifest as small perturbations on neutrino and antineutrino
    oscillations over a long baseline
  \item sterile neutrino states that mix with the three known active neutrino states
  \item large compactified extra dimensions from String Theory models that manifest through mixing
    between the Kaluza-Klein states and the three active neutrino
    states
   \item Lorentz and CPT violation due to an underlying Planck-scale theory that manifest through sidereal dependence on the neutrino oscillation probability
  \end{itemize}
  Full exploitation of DUNE's sensitivity to such new phenomena
  will require high-precision predictions of the unoscillated
  neutrino flux at the far detector and large exposures. Studies will be conducted to understand the
limits that DUNE could impose relative to current limits and those expected from other experiments.
  
\subsection{Search for Nonstandard Interactions}

For $\nu_{\mu,e} \rightarrow \nu_{e,\mu}$ 
oscillations that occur as the neutrinos propagate through matter,  
the coherent forward scattering of $\nu_e$'s on electrons in matter 
modifies the energy and path-length dependence of the vacuum oscillation 
probability in a way that depends on the magnitude \emph{and} sign of $\Delta m^2_{31}$. 
This is  the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect~\cite{Mikheev:1986gs,Wolfenstein:1977ue}.
NC nonstandard interactions (NSI) may be interpreted as nonstandard
matter effects that are visible only in a far detector at a
sufficiently long baseline. 
They can be parameterized as new contributions
to the MSW matrix in the neutrino-propagation Hamiltonian~\cite{Valle:1987gv,Roulet:1991sm}:

\begin{equation}
  H = U \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
           0 &                    & \\
             & \Delta m_{21}^2/2E & \\
             &                    & \Delta m_{31}^2/2E
         \end{array} \right) U^\dag + \tilde{V}_{\rm MSW} \,,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{V}_{\rm MSW} = \sqrt{2} G_F N_e
\left(
  \begin{array}{ccc}
    1 + \epsilon^m_{ee}       & \epsilon^m_{e\mu}       & \epsilon^m_{e\tau}  \\
        \epsilon^{m*}_{e\mu}  & \epsilon^m_{\mu\mu}     & \epsilon^m_{\mu\tau} \\
        \epsilon^{m*}_{e\tau} & \epsilon^{m*}_{\mu\tau} & \epsilon^m_{\tau\tau}
  \end{array} 
\right)
\end{equation}

Here, $U$ is the leptonic mixing matrix, and the $\epsilon$-parameters give the
magnitude of the NSI relative to standard weak interactions.  For new physics
scales of a few hundred GeV,  a value of $|\epsilon| \leq 0.01$ is
expected~\cite{Davidson:2003ha,GonzalezGarcia:2007ib,Biggio:2009nt,Barranco:2007ej,Escrihuela:2011cf}.
DUNE's 1300-km baseline provides an advantage in the detection of NSI relative
to existing beam-based experiments with shorter baselines.
Only atmospheric-neutrino experiments have longer baselines, but the sensitivity
of these experiments to NSI is limited by systematic effects. See \cite{Adams:2013qkq}
for potential sensitivities to these parameters at a 1300-km baseline.

\subsection{Search for Long-Range Interactions}

The small scale of neutrino-mass differences implies that minute
differences in the interactions of neutrinos and antineutrinos with
currently unknown particles or forces may be detected through 
perturbations to the time evolution of the flavor eigenstates.  
The longer the experimental
baseline, the higher the sensitivity to a new long-distance potential
acting on neutrinos. For example, some of the models for such
long-range interactions (LRI) as described in~\cite{Davoudiasl:2011sz} could contain discrete symmetries that
stabilize the proton and give rise to a dark-matter candidate particle,
thus providing new
connections between neutrino, proton decay and dark matter
experiments. The longer baseline of DUNE improves the sensitivity to
LRI beyond that possible with the current generation of long-baseline
neutrino experiments. The sensitivity will be determined by the amount
of $\nu_\mu/\overline{\nu}_\mu$-CC statistics accumulated and the accuracy
with which the unoscillated and oscillated $\nu_\mu$ spectra can be
determined.

\subsection{Search for Mixing between Active and Sterile Neutrinos}

Several recent anomalous experimental results count among their possible
interpretations phenomena that do not fit in the three-flavor mixing
model~\cite{Aguilar:2001ty,AguilarArevalo:2007it,Aguilar-Arevalo:2013pmq,Mention:2011rk,Giunti:2010zu}, 
and searches for evidence of one or more sterile neutrino states are ongoing.
At DUNE, searches for active-sterile neutrino mixing can be
conducted by examining the NC event rate at the far detector and
comparing it to a precise estimate of the expected rate extrapolated
from $\nu_\mu$ flux measurements from the  
near detector and from 
beam and detector simulations. Observed deficits in the NC rate could be evidence for mixing between the
active neutrino states and unknown sterile neutrino states. The most recent such search
in a long-baseline experiment was conducted by the MINOS
experiment~\cite{Adamson:2011ku,Sousa:2015bxa}.  DUNE will provide a unique
opportunity to revisit this search over a large
range of neutrino energies and a longer baseline. The large detector mass and high beam power will
allow a high-statistics sample of NC interactions to be collected.
The high-resolution LArTPC far detector
will enable a coarse measurement of the incoming neutrino
energy in a NC interaction by using the event topology and correcting
for the missing energy of the invisible neutrino.  Both the
energy spectrum and the rate of NC interactions will be measured
with high precision at both near and far detectors.

\subsection{Search for Large Extra Dimensions}

Several theoretical models propose that right-handed neutrinos
propagate in large compactified extra dimensions, whereas the standard
left-handed neutrinos are confined to the four-dimensional 
brane~\cite{Machado:2011wx}. Mixing between the right-handed \emph{Kaluza-Klein} 
modes and the standard
neutrinos would change the mixing patterns predicted by
the three-flavor model. The effects could manifest, for example, as distortions in the
disappearance spectrum of $\nu_\mu$.  The rich oscillation
structure visible in DUNE, measured with
its high-resolution detector
using both beam and atmospheric oscillations,
could provide further opportunities to probe for
this type of new physics.

\subsection{Search for Lorentz and CPT Violation}

Lorentz invariance and its associated CPT symmetry
are foundational aspects of the Standard Model. However, the Standard Model is thought to be a low-energy limit of a more fundamental theory that unifies quantum physics with gravity at the Planck
scale. As a result, an underlying theory can induce violations of Lorentz invariance and
violations of CPT symmetry that can generate experimentally observable signals of Planck-scale physics.
The Standard-Model Extension (SME)~\cite{Colladay:1996iz,Colladay:1998fq,Kostelecky:2003fs} is an effective field theory that contains the Standard Model, general relativity, and all possible operators that break Lorentz symmetry. (Since CPT violation implies Lorentz violation, the SME necessarily includes operators that break CPT symmetry.)  Within the SME framework, the probability for neutrino oscillations depends on the direction of neutrino propagation within a Sun-centered inertial frame~\cite{Kostelecky:2003cr,Kostelecky:2011gq}.  For a long-baseline experiment with both the neutrino beam source and detector fixed to the surface of the Earth, the Earth's rotation causes the direction of neutrino propagation to change with sidereal time.  The SME theory thus predicts a sidereal dependence of the observed beam neutrino rate.  DUNE has the potential to perform studies that explore regimes never previously investigated and to improve existing
sensitivities obtained in other neutrino experiments.
For example, the baseline of 1300~km offers an advantage because the sensitivity to 
% the coefficients for
Lorentz and CPT violation grows linearly with the baseline.   The
beam orientation for DUNE is different from other experiments such as MINOS or T2K, so
the combinations of coefficients for Lorentz and CPT violation appearing in the DUNE mixing probabilities are
distinct. Additionally, the wide range of energy for the beam neutrinos and the ability to investigate both neutrino and antineutrino channels are advantageous.

\section{Neutrino Beam Requirements}
\label{sec:physics-lbnosc-beam-req}
The LBNF neutrino facility at Fermilab utilizes a conventional
horn-focused neutrino beam produced from pion and kaon decay-in-flight. It will
aim the neutrino beam toward the 
the DUNE far detector located 1,300 km away at the Sanford Underground
Research Facility. LBNF must be designed for approximately twenty years of operation, in order to provide adequate exposure for the DUNE experiment. During its lifetime, the facility must be able to accommodate various target and focusing configurations to enable tunability 
in the neutrino energy spectrum, and must be suitable for upgraded targets and horns as technology improves and the primary proton beam power increases. Such
flexibility is an essential requirement for a facility that will operate over multiple decades. The energy range of the neutrino beam must be adaptable, in order to address new questions in neutrino physics that may come up during such a long period.

The DUNE experiment requires that the LBNF facility
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Shall generate a high intensity, wide-band neutrino beam,
  selectable for muon neutrinos or muon antineutrinos with a low
  contamination of electron and wrong-sign neutrinos.
\item Shall fully cover the energy range of the first oscillation
  node, which ranges from $\sim1$ GeV to $\sim5$ GeV and peaks at
  $\sim2.4$ GeV for a 1300 km baseline. It shall also provide a
  neutrino flux as high as reasonably achievable around the second
  oscillation node, which peaks at $\sim0.8$ GeV, possibly requiring
  a dedicated focusing configuration. An energy range extending
  from 0.5 to 5 GeV is necessary to provide the maximum sensitivity
  for CP violation searches and the determination of the neutrino mass
  hierarchy. Focusing configurations providing neutrino energies
  higher than 5 GeV may also be required for a full exploration of the
  three-neutrino paradigm and to address anomalies that may arise
  during the two decade lifetime of the experiment. 
\item Shall be capable of operating with a single-turn extracted primary proton beam
  from the Main Injector with greater than 2 MW of power. It must be
  able to accept proton momenta between 60 and 120 GeV/c, since this
  will enable some optimization of the neutrino energy spectrum. The
  capability to lower the energy of the protons is also an
  effective way to reduce the wrong-sign component in the neutrino
  flux. A reduction of up to $\sim15 \%$ in beam power is expected as
  the momentum of the primary protons decreases from 120 to 60 GeV/c,
  since the Main Injector cycle time does not scale linearly with the
  energy of the accelerated protons.  Table~\ref{tab:beam_req_pot} gives a
  summary of the expected number of protons on target per year at
  various momenta assuming a combined uptime and efficiency of 56\%. 
\item Shall be built to provide a realistic estimation and whenever
  possible a reduction of the systematic errors on the neutrino flux prediction, e. g. by adequate requirements on the alignment tolerances of the beamline components. Dedicated hadroproduction measurements from 60-120 GeV/c protons will be needed to reduce the uncertainty on the neutrino flux components, both from pion and kaon decays. 
\item Shall be built to ensure the stability of the produced neutrino flux by minimizing variations in targeting angle and position of the primary proton beam, short and long term displacement of the components of the focusing system, and variations in the current pulse to the horns.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{cdrtable}[Expected POT per year at various primary proton beam

\end{cdrtable}

\subsection{Reference Beam Design}
\label{sec:reference-design-focusing-system}
The reference beam design is described in detail in Volume 3. It
includes a target similar to the one used for the low-energy tune of
the NuMI beam~\cite{numitdr}, but with a larger thickness to
accommodate the 1.2 MW primary proton beam, and focusing horns
essentially identical to those currently in operation in the NuMI
beamline~\cite{numitdr}. The target consists of 47 graphite segments,
for a total length of 95 cm including the space between segments,
corresponding to two interaction lengths. The upstream face of the
first segment is positioned 45 cm upstream of the first focusing horn to ensure sufficient clearance of the target's downstream end from the horn inner conductor. The separation of the upstream faces of the two horns has been decreased to 6.6 m, compared to the 10 m distance for the low-energy tune of the NuMI beam, to slightly enhance the neutrino flux at lower energies. A helium-filled decay pipe, 4 m in diameter and 204 m in length, provides the decay volume for the secondary pions to decay to muon neutrinos. 

Neutrino fluxes for the reference beam are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:beam_req_reference_flux} for a 120 GeV primary proton
beam.  Lowering the momentum of the primary proton beam increases
right-sign neutrino flux at low energies and decreases wrong-sign
contamination.  Figure~\ref{fig:beam_req_proton_energy} shows current
projections of power versus proton energy, we estimate that 
$\delta_{CP}$ and mass hierarchy sensitivities improve modestly as
proton energy decreases, until approximately 60 GeV, below which the
Main Injector cycle time becomes constant with proton energy, causing
beam power to drop sharply.   Unless otherwise noted, results
throughout this volume assume an 80 GeV proton beam, corresponding to
the optimal momentum whose technical feasibility has been thoroughly
studied.  

Another handle for tuning the neutrino energy
spectrum of the reference beam is modification of the distance between
the target and the first focusing horn.  The expected fluxes for three
different configurations are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:beam_req_lemehe}. The improvement in flux for each configuration with a longer decay pipe length of 250 m is also shown.

\subsection{Optimized Beam Options}
\label{sec:alternative-focusing-systems}

There are several potential modifications to the reference beam design that would improve the experiment's sensitivity to the CP violating phase and mass hierarchy. 
One option, which we will call enhanced reference beam, is based on 
the NuMI focusing horn design but uses a thinner and shorter 
cylindrical beryllium target positioned 25 cm upstream of the first 
focusing horn. We consider two decay pipe configurations for this 
enhanced reference beam, one 204 m long and 6 m in diameter and the other 
250 m long and 4 meters in diameter.  The neutrino fluxes for these 
options, generated with an 80 GeV/c primary proton beam, are shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:beam_req_focusing_comp}. 
  
The option offering the largest gains in sensitivity is a redesign of the focusing system, including target and horns, which would require a modification of the dimensions 
of the present target chase.  To identify optimal designs, a genetic algorithm has been implemented to search for beam configurations that maximize sensitivity to CP violation. 
The procedure is inspired by a similar one developed by the LBNO collaboration~\cite{Agarwalla:2014tca}, and considers 20 beamline parameters governing the primary proton energy, target dimensions, 
and horn shapes, positions and current. Figure~\ref{fig:beam_req_opthorn} shows the shape and the relative parameters used for the optimization of the first focusing horn, 
while the second focusing horn is modeled as a NuMI-style horn, but allowed to rescale both in radial and longitudinal dimensions. The procedure yields horn size and shapes 
similar to those found by the LBNO collaboration. The first focusing horn is $\sim 5.5$ m in length and $\sim 1.3$ m in diameter. This 
optimized beam configuration includes a second focusing horn that is 32\% longer and 7.8 m further downstream than that of the reference focusing design.  This option would 
require an increase both in length, by $\sim 9$ m, and in width, by 
$\sim 60$ cm, of the target chase in the reference design.  Figure~\ref{fig:beam_req_focusing_comp} shows a comparison of fluxes 
for the reference, enhanced reference and optimized beam configurations. This
optimized beam, with a decay pipe 204 m long and 4 m in diameter,
produces a muon neutrino flux that is 20\% greater than the nominal
configuration at the first oscillation maximum (between 1.5 and 4 GeV), 
53\% greater at the second oscillation maximum (between 0.5 and 1.5 GeV), and reduces the
antineutrino contamination of the beam.   Sensitivity to $\delta_{CP}$ and the mass hierarchy as 
a function of the exposure for reference and alternative beam options
are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:beam_req_sensitivities}.  The optimized beam leads to improvements in sensitivity to both mass hierarchy 
and CP violation. Refinement of the optimization procedure, including
verification of the results with alternate hadron production models, and evaluation of the feasibility of the optimized designs are in progress.

\section{Detector Requirements}
\label{sec:physics-lbnosc-det-req}

\subsection{Far Detector Requirements}
\label{sec:physics-lbnosc-fd-req}

The DUNE Far Detector (FD) requirements relevant to long-baseline neutrino oscillation physics include:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Identification of Electron Neutrino and Antineutrino Events: The FD shall be capable of identifying electron neutrino and antineutrino charged current beam events in sufficient numbers within the fiducial volume of the detector. The neutrino flavor of the event will be identified by clearly identifying the primary final state charged electron. The total energy of the charged current event shall be measured. 
 \item Muon Neutrino and Antineutrino Events: The FD shall be capable of identifying muon neutrino and antineutrino charged current beam events in sufficient numbers within the fiducial volume of the detector and identify the primary muon particle emerging from the main event vertex.  The total energy of the charged current event shall be measured. 
 \item Multiple tracks and Electromagnetic Showers: The FD shall be capable of identifying events with multiple electromagnetic showers and non-showering particles produced within the fiducial volume of the detector.
 \item Baseline Length: A baseline of sufficient length shall be established between the neutrino beam facility and a far detector facility so that the difference between muon to electron neutrino conversion for the two cases of neutrino mass ordering can be clearly separated from the variation due to the CP phase, leading to unique determination of the CP phase.
 \item  Cosmic Ray Shielding: The FD shall be located at a depth to reduce the number of in-time (within the beam spill time) cosmic ray background so that it does not contribute more than 1\% of the final beam neutrino sample. 
 \item CP Phase Measurement: The total number of observed electron-neutrino and electron-antineutrino type events -- including consideration of background -- shall be sufficient to measure the CP phase to better than 3 sigma at the maximum CP violation. 
 \item Time Accuracy: Individual event times shall be measured with sufficient time accuracy to allow correlation of event times between detectors that are geographically separated. In the case of long-baseline oscillations, this would include correlation between the DUNE near and far detectors.  
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Near Detector Requirements}
\label{sec:physics-lbnosc-nd-req}

The DUNE Near Detector (ND) requirements relevant to long-baseline neutrino oscillation physics include:
\begin{itemize}
 \item FD measurements not limited by ND: ND measurements shall be of sufficient precision to ensure that when extrapolated to FD to predict the FD event spectra without oscillations, the associated systematic error must be significantly less than the statistical error over the lifetime of the experiment. 
 \item Muon Neutrino and Antineutrino Flux measurements: The ND shall measure the absolute and relative muon neutrino and antineutrino spectra separately.
 \item Electron Neutrino and Antineutrino Flux measurements: The ND shall measure the electron-neutrino and antineutrino contamination spectra of the beam separately in order to render the CP measurement as precise as possible.
 \item Background Measurements: The ND shall measure rates, kinematic distributions and detailed topologies of physics processes that could mimic signal events in the FD nuclear targets. This measurement shall be made with sufficient resolution to allow FD background calculation with precision that does not limit the oscillation measurements.
 \item Cross section measurements I: The ND will measure CC and NC cross sections separately as a function of hadronic energy.
 \item Cross section measurements II: The ND shall characterize various exclusive and semi-exclusive processes such as quasi-elastic interactions, resonance production, deep inelastic scattering, and neutrino-electron and neutrino-proton elastic scattering.
