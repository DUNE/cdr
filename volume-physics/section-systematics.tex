Sensitivity studies presented in Section~\ref{sec:physics-lbnosc-senscalc} test the ability to distinguish
the expected number of \nue appearance and \numu disappearance events given a set of oscillation parameters
from the expectations given an alternate set of parameters. For example, the CP violation and MH sensitivity
studies test the spectral differences induced by shifting \deltacp away from 0.0 and $\pi$ and by changing the
mass hierarchy. These differences are quantified with a test statistic (see Eq.~\ref{eq:dx2_MH}~-~\ref{eq:dx2_CP}) 
which accounts for statistical and systematic uncertainties. 

The effect of systematic uncertainty in the models used to 
predict these spectra is included by allowing the parameters to vary within Gaussian ranges. In the fits,
these systematic nuisance parameters are profiled, i.e. the set of nuisance parameters that produces the
minimum value of the test statistic is chosen.  The central values of the oscillation
parameters and their relative uncertainties are taken from the Nu-Fit~\cite{Gonzalez-Garcia:2014bfa} global
fit to neutrino data; these values are given in Table~\ref{tab:oscpar_nufit}. Uncertainty in non-oscillation
parameters is approximated using
normalization uncertainties on each constituent interaction mode that comprise the signal and background
in each sample. The values for these normalization uncertainties are chosen based on current constraints
on underlying model parameters, the ability of previous experiments to constrain these quantities,
and the expected ability of the DUNE Near Detector (ND) as outlined in Section~\ref{reftoND}.
Consideration is also given to the specific sources of uncertainty that go into each of the effective normalization
parameters and how the normalization parameters
may be correlated among the Far Detector (FD) analysis samples that will be fit in combination.

%In the sensitivities presented in Section ~\ref{sec:physics-lbnosc-senscalc},
%the \nue and \anue signal normalization uncertainties are $5\% \oplus 2\%$, implemented as
%5\% signal normalization uncertainties on the \numu and \anumu samples and
%2\% on the \nue and \anue samples. These four signal normalization uncertainties
%are treated as 100\% uncorrelated so that the 2\% normalization uncertainty on the
%\nue sample represents a residual normalization uncertainty after constraints
%from the near detector, the \numu disappearance samples, and the \anue sample have been applied.
%The normalization uncertainties on background to these samples and the correlation among those
%uncertainties are presented in Table~\ref{tab:bgnormsys}. The result of the correlations
%described in Table~\ref{tab:bgnormsys} is that there are five independent background
%normalization uncertainties: beam \nue, beam \anue, \numu/NC background to appearance mode,
%NC background to disappearance mode, and $\nu_\tau$. 


In the following sections, we present a justification for the chosen values of the signal and background
normalization uncertainties and their respective correlations.
Studies that consider the effect of varying the size of the residual normalization
uncertainties on the \nue and \anue samples are also presented.
Finally we describe the ongoing effort to characterize and evaluate the effect of individual sources
of uncertainty when propagated to oscillation parameter measurements in the DUNE experiment.

\subsection{Far Detector Samples}
\label{sec:syst_just}
Uncertainties in DUNE will be constrained by external data, near detector data, and the combined
fit to the four (\nue appearance, \anue appearance, \numu disappearance, \anumu disappearance) far detector samples.
The \numu disappearance analysis sample is composed of \numu CC interactions with backgrounds from NC
interactions in which a charged pion is misidentified a muon and $\nu_{\tau}$ CC interactions in which the resulting
tau decays to a muon and two neutrinos.
The unoscillated \numu flux and related cross sections are expected to be well-constrained by the near detector.
The uncertainty on the neutral current (NC) background comes primarily from uncertainty in pion production rates
for the coherent, resonance and DIS channels, as well as modeling of pion topological signatures that
determine the likelihood of it being misidentified as a muon.
%The charged pion misidentification rate, and its associated
%uncertainty, is highly correlated with the fraction
%of pions that either exit the detector, are absorbed by nuclei, or expend their kinetic before interacting
%hadronically, and thus have the topological characteristics of a muon.
%These relative rates of these processes will be constrained by the ND.
Uncertainties in the $\nu_{\tau}$ CC background level arise from the uncertainty in the $\nu_{\tau}$/\numu
cross-section ratio, which cannot be constrained by ND measurements. Each of these three samples are
assigned a normalization unceratainty. 

The \nue appearance sample is composed of electron neutrinos resulting from \numu$\rightarrow$\nue oscillation,
intrinsic beam \nue, NC and
%high-y$_{bj}$
\numu CC interactions in which a photon from a final-state neutral pion is
misidentified as an electron, and $\nu_{\tau}$ interactions in which the resulting $\tau$
decays to an electron and
two neutrinos. Since the
\numu disappearance signal and the \nue appearance signal are produced by the same flux,
%, flux uncertainty is constrained in the three-flavor fit.
%For example, changing the flux will increase the relative rates of the numu and nue samples the amount,
%while adjusting q23 will cause one sample to rise and the other to fall.
the \nue appearance signal is constrained relative to the \numu
signal. The residual uncorrelated uncertainty on the \nue signal results from the statistical
limitations of the \numu constraint, differences in energy scale and selection efficiency between the samples,
and theoretical uncertainties on the \nue/\numu cross-section ratio.
%These factors all contribute to the \nue signal normalization parameter uncertainty.
The uncertainty on the intrinsic
beam \nue background is dominated by flux uncertainties which are constrained by the near detector.
Predictions for NC and \numu CC background rates are again limited by the uncertainties on pion
production rates,
%and the uncertainty assigned to the normalization parameter for the \nue appearance sample combines uncertainties
the $\pi^{0}/\pi^{\pm}$ production ratio, and
differences in selection efficiencies.
%There are correlations between the charged and neutral pion production rates, allowing for
%cancellation of uncertainty in this background between the \nue and \numu samples.
%However, to be conservative the NC+CCnumu backgrounds in the nue are allowed to vary by an additional
%uncorrelated 5% to account for differences in pi0/pi+- production rates, and detection/selection efficiencies.
Again, the $\nu_{\tau}$ background uncertainties are related to cross-section ratio uncertainties
which are 100\% correlated among samples.

The far detector samples for the antineutrino beam mirror those described above for the neutrino beam.
Additional constraints are expected to occur in a fit to both neutrino and antineutrino beam samples;
variations in \deltacp induce opposite effects (in both shape and rate) in the \nue and \anue samples,
while most systematic uncertainties have a positively correlated effect.
%Notable correlation considerations between
In the neutrino and antineutrino samples,
NC background to the \numu and \anumu samples is treated as 100\% correlated,
as is NC and \numu CC background to the \nue and \anue samples.
Signal and beam \nue background normalization is treated as uncorrelated.
The normalization for \nutau CC background is treated as 100\% correlated among all samples.

%% Similar arguments can be made for the antineutrino (RHC) beam samples, and therefore the same effective normalization uncertainties are used. The choice of uncertainties on the effective normalization parameters also reflect the significant cancellations achieved in the 4-sample fit resulting from the addition of 1) relating the nuebar app samples to the numubar dis samples, and 2) from the fact that variations in dcp induce opposite effects (in both shape and rate) in nue and nuebar samples, while most systematics have a positively correlated effect. In these choices it is conservatively assumed that the nu (FHC) flux and the nubar (RHC) flux are not correlated. The only systematic thought to be able to induce an anti-symmetric response between the nue and nuebar samples comes from FSIs. This will require careful constraint from ND analysis, external data, and comparisons of nue to numu, and nuebar to numubar, where the peak of the appearance and the trough of the disappearance samples must be the same. 

Energy scale uncertainties in these samples, which can affect the shape of the reconstructed energy spectra,
result from
inaccurate models of detector response, missing energy in the hadronic systems (primarily from neutron production),
and from final-state interactions (FSI). The dominant source of uncertainty is the hadronic energy scale,
which is the same for both \nue and \numu samples, so relative energy scale uncertainties are limited to
differences in kinematics between \numu and \nue interactions and differences in detector response for
muons and electrons, which will be highly constrained by test beam experiments.
Systematic uncertainties stemming from the FSI model are thought to be able to induce an anti-correlated 
energy scale difference between the $\nu$ and $\bar\nu$ samples. This has the potential to mimic the effects
of a non-zero or $\pi$ value of \deltacp. The effect will however be the same in the \nue (\anue) and \numu
(\anumu) samples, allowing the relative \nue/\numu (\anue/\anumu) energy scale to be fixed by comparing
the peak of the appearance and the trough of the disappearance spectra. Additional constraints on the FSI 
model will be required from ND analyses and external data.

\subsection{Projecting Uncertainties Based on Previous Experience}

Table~\ref{tab:nuesysts} shows the uncertainties in a \nue appearance analysis achieved by MINOS~\cite{Adamson:2013ue}
and T2K~\cite{Abe:2015awa} compared to the goal uncertainties in DUNE. These goals are chosen by determining which
of the existing experiments is more representative of DUNE for each source
of systematic uncertainty and then setting a reasonable goal for a next-generation
experiment. The goals are based on expected capabilities of the high-resolution
LAr TPC far detector, precise measurements expected from a highly-capable near detector,
and well-understood analysis techniques developed in the existing generation of experiments.
Explanation of the choices in Table~\ref{tab:nuesysts} follow.

\subsubsection{Flux Uncertainties}
\label{sec:syst_just_flux}
DUNE plans to take advantage of spectral analysis,
meaning that absolute and relative flux normalization is required. Since the MINOS \nue appearance analysis
is based on normalization only, in terms of the \nue appearance analysis, DUNE will be more like T2K,
which has achieved 3.2\% normalization uncertainty on their \nue sample due to flux. Additionally, for a more apt
comparison to MINOS performance, the inclusive neutrino charged current cross-section measurement from the MINOS
near detector reported in \cite{xxx} has acheived a normalization uncertainty of $\sim$2\% in the
range $3 < E_\nu < 9$ GeV and the near-to-far \numu unoscillated-spectrum extraplolation errors in MINOS
are $<$3\% without any independent constraints on hadron production or muon flux measurements at the near
site. Therefore, as DUNE is planned to have a highly capable near detector, beam line
muon detectors, dedicated hadronization measurements, and improved simulation of beam flux based on MINERvA
measurements in the NuMI beam, we set a goal uncertainty on \nue signal
normalization from uncertainties in the flux determination of 2\%.
As described in Section \ref{sec:syst_studies_ind}, preliminary
studies of the FGT ND support this estimate, predicting 2\% uncertainty on the absolute flux and 1-2\%
uncertainty on the flux shape.
\subsubsection{Interaction Model Uncertainties}
\label{sec:syst_just_sim}
This category of uncertainties arise primarily from uncertainties in modeling neutrino interactions with the target
nuclei in the near and far detectors. These uncertainties include \nue and \numu cross-section uncertainties,
uncertainties from modeling the structure of the target nucleus, and the impact of
hadronization model uncertainties in simulating the break up of the target nucleus in higher-energy inelastic
interactions. DUNE will employ argon nuclear targets in both the near and far detectors, allowing for a larger
cancellation of interaction model uncertainties than in T2K, in which the target nuclei in the near detector are
carbon while those in the far detector are oxygen. Additionally, the angular resolution, vertex resolution,
and particle identification capability of the DUNE near detector are expected to increase its ability to
constrain those cross-section uncertainties which are common between near and far detectors, but for which
the T2K near detector could not provide significant constraint.
Finally, DUNE's high-resolution near
detector is expected to enable further constraints on hadronization uncertainties, relative to MINOS, by
resolving many of the individual particles produced in the resonance and deep-inelastic scattering interactions
which represent the majority of the DUNE data sample. Therefore, we take 2\% as a goal for the effect of
interaction model uncertainties on DUNE \nue signal normalization. It is important to note that this level of
uncertainty depends upon the ability to isolate neutrino-argon interactions in the near detector to facilitate
cancellation of near-far uncertainties; this is a requirement of the ND design.

Additionally, in considering the effect of the three-flavor analysis on the final uncertainty,
the neutrino beams in DUNE and MINOS have energy
spectra that peak around 2.5-3.0~GeV, compared to 600~MeV in T2K. 
The theoretical uncertainty on the \nue/\numu cross-section ratio is
less than 1\% above neutrino energoes of 1.0-1.5 GeV~\cite{Day-McFarland:2012},
a factor of about three smaller than at T2K's median energy,
so the uncertainty on the \nue normalization with respect to the \numu spectrum in DUNE will be
significantly improved compared to T2K. [INSERT nu/nubar argument here]
As described in Section~\ref{sec:syst_studies_ind}, preliminary studies with a Fast MC demonstrate the
expected cancellation of cross-section uncertainties in the DUNE three-flavor analysis.

\subsubsection{\nue Energy Scale Uncertainties}
\label{sec:syst_just_fd}
MINOS and T2K have acheived uncertainty in the \nue signal normalization from \nue energy scale
of 2.7\% and 2.5\% respectively,
where the 2.5\% from T2K actually includes most far detector effects. DUNE's LAr TPC far detector
is expected to outperform both the MINOS sampling calorimeter and the T2K water Cerenkov detector
in reconstruction of \nue interactions. Purity of the quasielastic-like event selection
should be improved relative to T2K by the capability of the LAr TPC to detect hadronic showers
that would be below threshold in SuperK, as described in \cite{Mosel-Lalakulich-Gallmeister:2014}. For non-quasielastic-like
events, the low thresholds and high resolution of the DUNE LAr TPC will significantly improve
calorimetric reconstruction over the MINOS sampling calorimeter.
Significant experience with simulation, reconstruction, and calibration
of neutrino interactions in LAr TPCs is expected from the Intermediate Neutrino Program, particularly
Fermilab's SBN program which will include three LAr TPCs: SBND, $\mu$BooNE, and ICARUS. An active program of
prototypes and test beam measurements is planned to study the reconstruction of charged and neutral particles
in LAr TPCs; this suite of experiments includes the DUNE 35-ton prototype, LArIAT, CAPTAIN, and
the CERN neutrino platform single and dual phase prototypes.
Therefore, we set a goal of using the superior detector performance and the improvments
in understanding of LAr TPC energy response expected in the next 5-10 years to reduce the normalization uncertainty
from the \nue energy scale to 2\%.

In considering the effect of the three-flavor analysis on the final uncertainty, hadronic energy is expected
to contribute more than half of the total energy deposit for many \nue and \numu interactions in the DUNE
far detector. Since the hadronic energy scale does not depend on neutrino flavor, the uncertainties on this
portion of the LAr TPC energy response are expected to largely cancel in the DUNE three-flavor analysis, up
to kinematic differences in the \nue and \numu samples.
The contribution from neutrons will be different between the $\nu$ and $\bar{\nu}$
samples both because of the different
probabilities for neutrinos and antineutrinos to interact with protons and neutrons and because of differing
kinematics. The contribution from neutrons will also be different between the \nue and \numu samples because
these samples peak at different energies due to oscillation effects. For this reason, understanding
of neutron production and detector response to neutrons will be important for constraining uncertainty in
the three-sample fit. Deployment of the CAPTAIN detector in a neutron beam at LANL is planned to address
these issues.


\subsubsection{Total Uncertainties Assigned to the Normalization Parameters}
Based on the preceding considerations, the DUNE signal normalization uncertainty is taken to be
$5\% \oplus 2\%$ in both neutrino and antineutrino mode, where 5\% is the normalization uncertainty
on the FD \numu sample and 2\% is the effective uncorrelated
uncertainty on the FD \nue sample after fits to both near and far detector data and all external constraints.
These signal normalization parameters are treated as 100\% uncorrelated between neutrinos and antineutrinos.
The normalization uncertainties on background to these samples are given in Table \ref{tab:bgnormsys}.
These assumptions for the non-oscillation systematic uncertainties 
are used to calculate the sensitivities presented in Section ~\ref{sec:physics-lbnosc-senscalc}.
The goal for the \emph{total} uncertainty on the \nue sample in
DUNE is less than 4\%, so the $5\% \oplus 2\%$ signal normalization uncertainty
used for sensitivity calculations is appropriately conservative.
Additionally, significant cancellation of uncertainty is expected in the four-sample fit, so the
residual uncorrelated normalization uncertainty on the \nue sample is expected to be reduced to the 1-2\% level,
such that the 2\% residual normalization uncertainty used in the sensitivity calculations
is also well-justified. 
Variations on these assumptions are explored in the next subsection.

\subsection{Effect of Variation in Uncertainty}
Figure \ref{fig:exp_systs} shows the
change in DUNE sensitivity to determination of
neutrino mass hierarchy and discovery of CP violation
as a function of exposure for several levels of signal normalization uncertainty.
As seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:exp_systs}, for early phases of DUNE
with exposures less than 100 kt-MW-years, the experiment
will be statistically limited.
The impact of systematic uncertainty on the CP violation sensitivity for large exposure
is obvious in Fig.~\ref{fig:exp_systs}; the \nue signal normalization uncertainty must
be understood at the level of $5\% \oplus 2\%$ in order to reach 5$\sigma$ sensitivity for
75\% of \deltacp values with exposures less than $\sim$900~kt-MW-years in the case of the
Optimized Design. Specifically, the absolute normalization of the \numu sample must be known to
$\sim$5\% and the normalization of the \nue sample,
relative to the \anue, \numu, and \anumu samples after all constraints from
external, near detector, and far detector data have been applied, must be determined 
at the few percent level. This level of systematic uncertainty sets the capability and
design requirements for all components of the experiment, including the beam design, and the
near and far detectors.
%

  equal running in neutrino and antineutrino mode, for a range of values for
  the \nue and \anue signal normalization uncertainties from $5\%\oplus3\%$ to
  $5\%\oplus1\%$. The sensitivities quoted

  mass hierarchy and 50\% (middle) or 75\% (right) of \deltacp values 
  in the case of CP violation. The two bands on each plot represent a range of potential
  beam designs: the blue hashed band is for the CDR Reference Design and the solid green

\end{cdrfigure}

Signal and
background normalization uncertainties remain
relatively unimportant for the mass hierarchy measurement, even at large exposure, when considering
minimum sensitivity for 100\% of \deltacp values. This is because the minimum sensitivity 
occurs in the near-degenerate region where it is difficult to determine
whether one is observing \deltacp $= + \pi/2 $ in the normal hierarchy
or \deltacp $=-\pi/2$ in the inverted hierarchy. Spectral analysis will
help resolve this near-degeneracy, but is dependent on as-yet
unexplored uncertainties in the spectral shape, which are expected to be dominated
by energy-scale uncertainty. Figure~\ref{fig:escale_syst} shows the
impact on MH and CP violation sensitivity of one possible energy scale variation, in which
energy bins are adjusted by N[E]$\rightarrow$N[(1+a)E], while keeping the total number of
events fixed. This is only one possible type of energy scale uncertainty; more comprehensive
study of energy scale uncertainty is in progress and will be included in
future analyses of experimental sensitivity.

\subsection{Ongoing Studies of Systematic Uncertainty}
\label{sec:syst_studies_ind}
Detailed evaluation of systematic uncertainties for DUNE is ongoing. In many cases plans for studies
have been developed but have not yet been executed. In general, each systematic will be studied both by
propagating its uncertainty to oscillation analyses to evaluate the resultant degradation of the sensitivity
and by ensuring the considered variations give proper coverage, i.e., truly encapsulate
the lack of knowledge of the processes/effects in question. Estimates of systematic uncertainty for the 
propagation studies will be varied between the constraints available from current external knowledge
and a range of projections for ND performance. In cases where systematic uncertainty is shown to
degrade the oscillation parameter
measurement sensitivities, the required constraints will become detector performance requirements.
The details of these studies are beyond the scope of this document; however, conclusions from some
initial studies and an overview of each source of systematic uncertainty is laid out in the remainder of
this section.

Initial studies using a Near Detector Fast Monte Carlo with a parameterized detector response
predict 2-3\% statistical uncertainties on the absolute flux using fully 
leptonic neutrino interactions for which high-precision cross-section predictions 
exist. Specifically,
the statistical uncertainty is expected to be 2\% for neutrino-electron
scattering ($E_\nu<5$~GeV) and 3\% for inverse muon decay ($E_\nu>11$~GeV).
Relative normalization using the low-$\nu_0$ method is
expected to constrain the flux shape and the near/far flux ratio to 1-2\%.
Studies using a multi-sample fit  to constrain the flux with simulated near detector
event samples show significant constraints on all flux
uncertainties; the post-fit uncertainty in most flux bins for this preliminary fit is less
than 5\%, which is the uncorrelated \numu signal normalization
uncertainty assumed by the sensitivity calculations. 

The two main sources of uncertainty in the beam simulation come from variations in the beam optics,
$\mathcal{O}($1\%), and uncertainties in the hadron production models, $\mathcal{O}$(10\%).
Beam optics have been studied in detail, and while the variations in the flux produced by these uncertainties
lead to large uncertainties in the FD-only fits, they are easily constrained by the ND. Software tools that
allow re-weighting of neutrinos based on their parent hadrons have been developed by MINERvA; we are working with
them port those tools to DUNE. In the meantime, MINERvA has agreed to provide their flux covariance matrix
that details the flux rate and shape uncertainties prior to ND constraints. We will combine this with DUNE
simulations to project reasonable hadron production uncertainties to ND and FD analyses.

Primary interaction uncertainties are specific to each model, and each of the three major
cross-section components (QE, resonance production, and DIS) contribute roughly equally to the \nue and \anue
appearance signal. In most cases, uncertainties in modeling primary interactions comes from the
hadronic interaction part of the calculation, which includes form factors in the hadron tensor,
the nuclear initial state, and FSI. 
The later two sources of uncertainty will be discussed in the context of nuclear models later in this
section. 

  \emph{Coherent scattering}: Coherent models built upon PCAC theory relate the neutrino scattering 
  cross section to pion-nucleon or pion-nucleus scattering data. The choice and characterization
  of that data can have large effects on the calculated cross section. Alternate 'microscopic model' 
  formulations are only valid only over limited kinematic ranges and are not adequate to describe this process 
  for DUNE. Both types of model suffer from limited data constraints over a range of neutrino energy
  and nuclear targets.
  However, the low hadron thresholds and good angular resolution of the proposed ND should be able
  to produce world-leading measurements and provide adequate constraints for this interaction channel and 
  its relatively small contribution to the overall cross section.

  \emph{Quasi-elastic processes (QE)}: These interactions are defined by low 4-momentum transfer and no excitation
  or breakup of the struck nucleon. Form factors in the cross-section models are well constrained by 
  electron scattering data, with the exception of the axial-vector contribution, which is
  constrained by $\nu$-hydrogen and $\nu$-deuterium scattering data.
  %Recent QE
  %scattering data off nuclei have seen
  Current constraints on the axial form factor are degraded because the free
  parameter, $M_{A}^{QE}$, has been expanded to an effective parameter to cover nuclear effects. 
  Improved nuclear models
  %, which will be discussed further below,
  have more detailed predictions
  of the nuclear initial state;
  %nucleon momentum distribution, and targets that reflect the dynamic
  %nature of the nucleus.
  ongoing studies are aimed at determining if the current large uncertainty 
  on $M_{A}^{QE}$ adequately reproduces the effects of more complex nuclear models.

  \emph{Resonance production}:
  %Resonance interactions account for roughly 1/3rd of the \nue appearance
  %signal, and major components of the backgrounds due to misidentified pions.
  The free model parameters for resonance production cross sections
  are again related to form factors that cannot be constrained by electron
  scattering data, specifically $M_{A}^{RES}$ and $C^{5}_{A}$.
  Disagreements among various datasets and models in the kinematics of outgoing pions
  persist even when FSI are considered.
  %There are major disagreements between various data sets, and between data and models, in the 
  %kinematics of the outgoing pions. These disagreements persist even when FSI and related uncertainties
  %are considered.
  Data from the INP and the DUNE ND should provide good constraints for DUNE
  oscillation analyses, but model improvements will be required to help propagate these constraints
  to the FD signal and background predictions. Model improvements are sought for the principal interaction
  model, so-called 'background' interactions where the pion is produced at the interaction vertex 
  rather than through an intermediate $\Delta$ (or higher resonance), the interference between the two
  models, and the contributions to single-pion production from low-multiplicity DIS.

  \emph{Deep inelastic scattering (DIS)}: The inclusive DIS cross section has been very well constrained by 
  data but individual final states have not. The uncertainty comes from the model that determines the
  content and kinematics of the hadronic system as a function of the invariant mass, $W$. The result is that
  the uncertainty on DIS contribution to the signal samples is relatively small, but the DIS contribution to
  background via pion production is quite large. Current studies are focused on building parameterized re-weighting 
  functions for the hadronization model based on GENIE samples generated with 1$\sigma$ changes to each relevant 
  model parameter.

Nuclear models enter into the simulation of neutrino interactions both through modeling of initial-state interactions,
i.e., interactions between the initial state of the nucleons and virtual particles within the nucleus with
the neutrino, and modeling of final-state interactions (FSI), i.e., interactions of the particles exiting the
primary interaction vertex with the nuclear medium. Uncertainties in initial-state interactions due to
naive modeling of the environment of the nucleus have thus far been taken into account through inflation
of the uncertainties on the free nucleon or quark interaction
model, such as $M_{A}^{QE}$. New models are being added to generators and will soon be incorporated into the Fast MC
to study how the impact on sensitivity of these models compares with uncertainties in the current nominal model.
Data from neutrino interactions in LAr TPCs from the INP will provide detailed information on nucleon production
rates and kinematics, which will help to distinguish which of the new models best describes the data.

Final-state interactions can alter event reconstruction in two distinct ways. The first is a smearing
of the total energy available to be deposited in the detector. The second is the misidentification of
event topologies used to classify the neutrino flavor and interaction mode. Uncertainties in selection
efficiencies and event-sample migrations
due to intranuclear rescattering can be studied with existing DUNE tools. The predictions and
uncertainties on GENIE's ``HA'' model of intranuclear interaction
are also being tested against the detailed FSI model in the GiBUU event
generator.

Results from a fit to Fast MC simulation of all four far detector samples
(\nue, \anue, \numu, \anumu) significantly
constrains cross-section systematic uncertainty even in the case where many
cross-section parameters are allowed to vary simultaneously within their
GENIE uncertainties. As seen in the example shown in Figure
\ref{fig:MAresqesyst}, 
a fit in which both $M_A^{QE,CC}$ and 
$M_A^{RES,CC}$ are allowed to vary within their GENIE uncertainties 
($\pm$20\%), which could significantly alter the energy distribution of the 
the selected events, results in a dramatic reduction in sensitivity if one 
considers only the $\nu_e$ appearance signal without constraint from the 
$\bar{\nu}_e$ and $\nu_{\mu}$/$\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ samples.
In contrast, for a four sample fit,
this same parameter variation results in only a small reduction in
sensitivity to CP violation.
This result includes a 10\% uncertainty in the $\nu/\bar{\nu}$
cross-section ratio and a 2.5\% uncertainty in the $\nu_e/\nu_{\mu}$
cross-section ratio.
Preliminary studies also
demonstrate significant constraint on cross-section systematics from the 
near detector. The validity of the GENIE model parameter uncertainties are being studied 
via comparisons with available data (e.g. MINERvA), and alternate models (e.g. the 
Intranuke intranuclear rescattering model and related uncertainties will be compared with GiBUU).
These comparisons are a high priority of the whole neutrino community as well as the DUNE collaboration.

Uncertainty stemming from detector effects
are somewhat more difficult to address with existing
simulation efforts. Tools to evaluate the effect of uncertainty in single-particle resolutions,
detection and particle-identification efficiencies, and energy scale are in development within
the Fast MC framework. The results of these studies will provide performance requirements
for the DUNE detectors, but more complete understanding of the expected size of these effects
will require comparison between data and a full Monte Carlo.
The status of efforts to develop reconstruction and analysis tools for a full Monte Carlo simulation
of DUNE is described in Section~\ref{sec:simreco}. At the same time,
a number of test-beam and prototype experiments, including the DUNE 35-t prototype,
LARIAT, CAPTAIN, and the CERN neutrino platform experiments, are being designed and built to reduce these
uncertainties with experimental data. The status of some of these efforts is described in
Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-proto}.
