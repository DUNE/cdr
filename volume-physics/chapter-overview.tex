\subsection{About this Volume}

\volphys\, outlines the science objectives in
Chapter~\ref{ch:physics-goals}, describes each of the areas of study in the following
chapters, and concludes with a summary.

The LBNF/DUNE science objectives are categorized as primary, ancillary and additional, 
with the primary objectives driving the experiment and facility designs that together will 
also enable pursuit of the ancillary objectives. 
Pursuit of the additional goals may require technological developments beyond the current designs.

Chapters~\ref{ch:physics-lbnosc},~\ref{ch:physics-atmpdk} and~\ref{ch:physics-snblowe}
describe the physics program for the DUNE far detector in the areas of long-baseline neutrino
oscillations, nucleon decay, atmospheric neutrinos and detection of supernova neutrino
bursts and low-energy neutrinos; they also discuss the requirements that these studies 
impose on the detector design.

Chapter~\ref{ch:physics-nd} discusses the role that the near detector plays in the overall DUNE
physics program and the requirements that it must satisfy, and describes the measurements and 
new physics searches that the near detector will enable on its own.
