\chapter{Summary of DUNE Detectors}
\label{ch:detectors-summary}

The DUNE experiment is a world-leading, international physics
experiment, bringing together a global neutrino community as well as
leading experts in nucleon decay and particle astrophysics to explore
key questions at the forefront of particle physics and
astrophysics. The massive, high-reolution near and far detectors will
enable an extensive suite of new physics measurements that are
expected to result in groundbreaking discoveries.

The far detector will be located deep underground at the 4850L of
SURF.  Its 40-kt fiducial mass of LAr will enable sensitive studies of
long-baseline oscillations with a 1,300~km baseline, as well as a rich
program in astroparticle physics and nucleon decay searches.  The far
detector configuration consists of four LArTPCs.  They provide
excellent tracking and calorimetry performance, high signal efficiency
and effective background discrimination, all of which converge to
provide an overall excellent capability to precisely measure neutrino
events and reconstruct kinematical properties with high
resolution. The full imaging of events will enable study of neutrino
interactions and other rare events to unprecedented levels.


The magnetized, high-resolution near detector will measure the spectrum 
and flavor composition of the neutrino beam extremely precisely, due to its
ability to separate neutrino and antineutrino  fluxes \fixme{or its ability to charge
discriminate electrons and muons produced in the neutrino charged
current interactions, not sure which}, enabling DUNE to 
reach unprecedented sensitivity in its long-baseline neutrino
oscillation studies.  \fixme{Mary, see my fixmes in vol 2 sec 3.9.2 that
relate to this}

This is the primary role of the near detector, however,
its exposure to an intense flux of neutrinos will provide an 
opportunity to collect unprecedentedly high neutrino
interaction statistics, making possible a wealth of fundamental neutrino
interaction measurements, an important component of the DUNE Collaboration's ancillary
scientific goals.

The spectrum and flavor composition of the neutrino beam will be
measured with high precision in the Near Detector (ND) in order to
reach the ultimate sensitivity for the long-baseline neutrino
oscillation studies.  The separation between fluxes of neutrinos and
antineutrinos requires a magnetized neutrino detector to charge
discriminate electrons and muons produced in the neutrino charged
current interactions.  This is the primary role of the ND, however,
being exposed to an intense flux of neutrinos will also provide the
opportunity to collect unprecedentedly high neutrino
interaction statistics for an extended science program.  The near detector will
provide an opportunity for a wealth of fundamental neutrino
interaction measurements, which are an important part of the secondary
scientific goals of the DUNE collaboration.  The reference design for
the neutrino near detector (NND) design is the NOMAD-inspired
fine-grained tracker. The NND subsystems consist of a central
straw-tube tracker and an electromagnetic calorimeter embedded in a
0.4-T dipole field. The steel of the magnet yoke will be instrumented
with muon detectors.
