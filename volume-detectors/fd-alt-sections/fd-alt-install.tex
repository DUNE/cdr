\subsection{Preparatory works}

Before the installation of the detector can begin, a number of
preparations must be conducted and boundary conditions must be met in
order to allow one for both a safe as well a cost and time efficient
realization of the detector installation. Some of the most important
preparation items are explained in more details in the Alternative Far
Detector Installation Annex.

\subsection{Detector installation sequence}

This procedure has been extensively studied in the framework of the
LAGUNA-LBNO design study. A construction sequence for the dual-phase
DUNE LArTPC detector installation was defined based on the use of a
slightly modified scaffolding arrangement with respect to the LBNO
design, as discussed in the Alternative Design Installation Annex
(Design: courtesy Technodyne Ltd., Eastleigh, UK). The proposed
construction sequence assumes completion of the membrane and
insulation system installation together with completion of all tank
internal pipework and cable trays.  At this stage, sections of the
scaffolding will be removed and replaced by the Alimak-Hek or similar
climbing access platforms to provide increased functionality to the
installation.  On completion of the scaffolding revisions and the
climbing access platform installation, the entire tank and scaffolding
systems will be cleaned in preparation for the detector
installation. The proposed far detector construction sequence consists
of:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Complete installation of insulation \& membrane, install cable trays from top to bottom for photomultipliers (PMTs) electrical cables}
\item{Adjust scaffolding platforms, add Alimak-Hek platform and floor protection}
\item{Air purge top level installation}
\item{Install hanging columns for detector}
\item{Install lowest field shaping coil to stabilize columns, and then install first top 15 levels of field shaping coils}
\item{Thoroughly clean top level assembly}
\item{Install Charge Readout (CRP) from top scaffolding platform (detailed sequences described below figure 7)}
\item{Thoroughly clean top level assembly}
\item{Screen off top level to protect Anode (protective screen 1)}
\item{Air purge top level (allow bleed air into middle \& lower levels)}
\item{Continue installing Field shaping coils}
\item{Complete installation of Field shaping coils}
\item{Thoroughly clean field shaping coils, remove protective screen (screen 1) to top level \& progressively remove all scaffolding \& Alimak-Hek platforms}
\item{Screen off field shaping coils (incl. CRO): protective screen 2}
\item{Air purge top \& middle levels}
\item{Construct Cathode from Modules. Cathode to be raised 300mm off tank bottom during construction}
\item{Thoroughly clean cathode \& space used for fabrication}
\item{Remove protective screen 2}
\item{Fit cathode to field cage using suitable jacks}
\item{Screen off entire detector: protective screen 3}
\item{Remove floor protection}
\item{Add cable trays, junction boxes \& cables for PMTs}
\item{Install PMTs to tank Bottom (pre-assembled L-flanges). Check out \& test PMTs}
\item{Clean air purge bottom level}
\item{Install temporary enclosure around TCO inside \& outside with air lock within the enclosure}
\item{ Remove protective screen (screen 3) using air lock system to prevent contamination of detector}
\item{Close temporary construction openings}
\item{Thoroughly clean TCO areas}
\item{Remove temporary enclosures}
\item{Remove all tools, equipment etc. through tank roof}
\item{Exit via room manways}
\item{Close all tank roof openings}
\end{enumerate}

Far Detector Installation Annex.

\subsection{Construction program of detector installation}


Both the $3\times3\times1$ $m^3$ prototype detector and the $6\times
6\times 6$ $m^3$ WA105 demonstrator are planned to be built in advance
of the larger $4\times 10kT$ modules of the experiment at Homestake.
It is envisaged that valuable information will be gathered from the
construction of both the prototype and demonstrator detectors that
will ultimately benefit both the planning and construction forecasting
for the larger Far Detector later on in the project.

For comparison the 20kT LAr detector, designed for Pyhasalmi had a
drift surface (roughly the CRP and cathode area) of 824 $m^2$ in
octagonal shape with a drift length of 20 m. The dual-phase DUNE LArTPC
experiment at Homestake has an equivalent area of 12 by 60 = 720 $m^2$
(for one module of 12kT) with a drift length of 12 to 15 m (fiducial
mass 1 kT / 1m drift, total 12 to 15kT). The construction program
calculated by Rockplan Ltd, Alan Auld Ltd and Rhyal Eng. Ltd can be
seen as a conservative approach for the Homestake site, as most of the
time is linked with the instrumented surface required and not so much
with the drift length, but specific Homestake site related effects and
effects of US legal procedure are not taken into account in this
construction program.

The detector program has been divided into 3 distinct (and separate) stages:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Design}
\item{Manufacture/Fabrication} 
\item{Construction}
\end{enumerate}  

The detector design must be done together with the tank deck design,
as the complete detector is suspended from the deck.  Fabrication and
manufacturing can be started while the tank construction is still
on-going.  The total time for manufacture/fabrication and construction
is calculated to be around 6 years for the LAr detector, of which:
\begin{itemize}
\item{14 months		for manufacture/fabrication off-site}
\item{20 months		for construction/installation + testing}
\item{32 months		total works (partially overlap)}
\end{itemize}
