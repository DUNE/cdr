\section{Overview}
\label{sec:detectors-fd-ref-ov}

This chapter describes an alternate design for one or more DUNE far detector modules. The first module to be installed will use the reference design. This alternate design implements a dual-phase liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) augmented with a light-readout system. ``Dual-phase'' refers to the extraction of ionization electrons at the interface between liquid and gas argon and their amplification and collection in the gas phase. 

The scope of the dual-phase far detector includes the design, procurement, fabrication, testing, delivery, installation and commissioning of the detector components: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Charge-Readout Planes (CRP)
\item Field Cage and High-Voltage System  
\item Electronics, Chimney and Data Acquisition 
\item Slow Controls
\item Light-Readout System
\end{itemize}

The components and the liquid argon will be housed in cryostats provided by LBNF, described in \vollbnf.  As for the reference design far detector, this alternate design satisfies the DUNE physics requirements already described in the reference design chapter. Some additional parameters specific to the double-phase design are listed in Table~\ref{tab:FD_req}. The alternate design provides as well some improvements with respect to the reference design (larger S/N and lower detection threshold, smaller pitch, smaller number of readout channels, two identical collection views, absence of dead material in the liquid argon volume) which will be described in more details in this section.

The alternate design is the result of 13 years of R\&D and two programs funded by the European Union, the LAGUNA-LBNO design study concluded in August 2017.  In collaboration with industrial partners, LAGUNA-LBNO defined an optimized and cost-effective configuration for a long-baseline experiment incorporating technological developments and innovative solutions. The studies were focused on the underground implementation of a very large liquid argon detector (GLACIER) and beyond the dual-phase readout concept involved many technical aspects such as the tank, the field cage, the cathode as well as the logistics the detector assembly sequence and full costing. The full design and the related technical developments are described in the deliverable documents submitted to the EU at the conclusion of the design study, included with this CDR as \anxlbnoa and \anxlbnob.

%The alternate detector benefits from 13 years of R\&D activity and two programs funded by the European Union for a total budget of 17 Million Euros which resulted in the LAGUNA-LBNO design study concluded in August 2014. The LAGUNA-LBNO design study allowed to define, in collaboration with several industrial partners, an optimized configuration for a long baseline experiment  experiment with associated technological developments, innovative solutions and full costing. In particular, since the very beginning, these studies were focused on the underground implementation of a very large liquid argon detector (GLACIER) aiming at optimizing the construction and installation costs and making affordable the detector implementation and operation. This optimization concerned not only the dual-phase readout concept but also many technical aspects related to the underground design and implementation such as the tank, the field cage, the cathode  and the definition of the logistics and the detector assembly sequence. All these technical developments are described in the deliverable documents submitted to the EU at the conclusion of the design study \cite{LAGUNA-LBNO-deliv}

Following the GLACIER concept  \cite{LAGUNA-LBNO-deliv} (see Figure~\ref{fig:LBNO_50}), the dual-phase LArTPC detector has a fully homogeneous liquid argon volume, where electrons drift vertically towards the liquid-vapor interface. From there they are extracted from the liquid into the gas phase, amplified, and collected on a segmented anode~\cite{Badertscher:2013wm,Badertscher:2012dq,Badertscher:2010zg}. The electron amplification in the gas phase 
enables a robust and tunable signal-to-noise ratio. Amplification of the ionization charges in the extremely pure argon gas is achieved by using micro-pattern avalanche gas detectors (Large Electron Multiplier, LEM). The detector configuration is similar to a single-phase LArTPC but the features of the dual-phase design enable very long drift paths and large detector dimensions while minimizing the number of readout channels.

\end{cdrfigure}

An extraction efficiency of  100\% of the electrons from the liquid to the gas phase is achieved with an electric field of the order of 2 kV/cm created by a submersed grid at the liquid-gas interface. The ionization charge is then amplified by avalanches occurring in the gas in the micro-pattern structure of the LEM and collected in a 2-dimensional readout plane on the top of the volume. Readout units, combining both the amplification and collection functions have an area of $0.5\times 0.5$~m$^2$ and are finely segmented with a 3.125~mm pitch strips. The typical amplification achieved in this configuration is around 20-100. It allows to compensate for the charge losses due to the presence of electronegative impurities along very long drift paths. Although the dual-phase TPC has longer drift length, it should be noted that it requires a liquid argon purity around 0.1~ppb = 100~ppt of oxygen equivalent (3 ms electron lifetime), similarly as for the single-phase TPC. These conditions can be reached by starting from commercially available ppm-level bulk argon and filling a non-evacuated vessel \cite{WA105_TDR}. The S/N ratio can exceed 100 for a particle at the ionization minimum (MIP) after a drift path of 12 m (for instance with an electron lifetime of 3 ms, a drift field of 0.5 kV/cm and a LEM gain of 180). With the same drift field and electron lifetime conditions and a LEM gain of 25 the S/N is larger than 50:1 for the first 6 m of drift and reaches 14:1  for MIP tracks after 12 m of drift.

The drift field ( $E{\simeq} 0.5-1.0$~kV/cm) inside the fully active LAr volume  is  produced by applying high voltage  to the cathode plane at the bottom of the cryostat and is kept uniform by a stack of equally spaced field shaping electrodes (field cage) polarized at linearly decreasing voltage from the cathode voltage to ground. Each electrode is made are  made from stainless-steel tubes along a rectangular path with round corners. The field cage is held in place by insulating mechanical structures hung from the top deck of the vessel.  The cathode structure is suspended from the field cage. The cathode plane is gridded and is transparent to allow the detection of the scintillation light by uniform arrays of photomultipliers mounted at the bottom of the tank, $1$ m  below the cathode surface. 

The drift field is closed at the top by the anode. It consists of a collection of modules for the charge readout: Charge Readout Planes (CRPs). Each CRP is composed of several  $0.5\times 0.5$~m$^2$ readout units and it is independently suspended with stainless-steel ropes linked to the top deck. This suspension system allows to adjust the CRP distance and parallelism with respect to the LAr surface. The electrical signals from the collected charges are then passed outside the tank via a set of dedicated signal feedthrough chimney traversing the top layer of insulation. These chimneys house at their bottom the cryogenic  Front End (FE) electronics.  The FE electronics are based on analog preamplifiers implemented in CMOS ASIC circuits for high integration and large scale affordable production. It  is cooled at a temperature around 110 K and is isolated with respect to the LAr vessel by a cold feedthrough. This feedthrough is  connected to the CRP via flat cables of 0.5 m length. The chimneys design allows to access and replace the FE from outside without contaminating the LAr volume. The digital electronics and DAQ system are completely outside the cryostat and are housed in micro-TCA racks mounted on each signal feedthrough chimney. Other feedthrough chimneys are foreseen for the cathode HV connection, the CRPs suspension and level adjustment, the high voltage and signal readout of the PMTs and the monitoring instrumentation (level meters, temperature probes, strain gauges, etc.)

Situated in the vapor phase on top of the LAr volume the CRP  provides an adjustable charge gain (with a minimal required gain of 20) and two independent readout views, each with a pitch of 3.125 mm.  Combined with the time information coming from the LAr scintillation readout by the PMT arrays (T0), the CRPs provide three-dimensional (3D) tracks imaging with dE/dx information. The S/N ratio is increased by at least one order of magnitude by the possibility of amplifying the charges with avalanches in the gas phase.  This high S/N significantly improves the event reconstruction quality. It also lowers the threshold for small energy depositions and provides a better resolution per volumetric pixel (voxel) compared to a conventional single-phase LAr-TPC. 

The dual-phase TPC concept is well suited for large detector sizes since the charge attenuation on long drift paths is compensated by the charge amplification in the CRPs.  This configuration also simplifies the construction by optimally exploiting long vertical dimensions of the cryostat, reducing the number of read-out channels, increasing the detector size, and lowering costs.  This provides inside the TPC field cage a large homogeneous fiducial volume for neutrino interactions, consisting only of liquid argon with no embedded passive materials. The charge produced in this volume is collected on the top CRPs surface in a projective way, with practically no dead regions. In each CRP the charge is readout in two collection views with no use of induction views, which is also an important asset in the case of complicated topologies. 

The dual-phase readout scheme has been successfully demonstrated on several prototypes  by an R\&D activity which spans over more than 10 years. 
The design of very large (20 to 50 kt) underground detectors based on this concept has been developed in great detail in the context of the LAGUNA and LAGUNA-LBNO design studies.  The CERN WA105 experiment is intended to show a full scale implementation of this technique, as well as of other technologies developed for the construction of large underground TPC detectors.  All the key subsystems of the WA105 DLAr TPC demonstrator have been designed taking into account their scalability to larger detector sizes.  In 2018, this demonstrator will be tested and calibrated with a charged particle beam (pion, muons, electrons).


\section{Detector Configuration}

The proposed detector module, based on the dual-phase design, optimally exploits the inner space foreseen for the DUNE cryostats ($14 (w) \times 14.1 (h) \times 62  (l)~m^3$) with an active area of  ($12 \times 60 ~m^2$) and a drift length of 12 m corresponding to 12.096 kton of LAr (10.643 kton fiducial). The design is based on the one for 20 kton LAr detector as the LAGUNA-LBNO design study with a CRP unit size re-adapted to the dimensions on the active area. The height of the DUNE cryostat could be increased in order to achieve 15m  drift. In that case a single detector would reach an active mass of 15.12 kton (13.444 kton fiducial).  This 15.1 kton  detector configuration, apart from the longer drift distance and field cage, would have the same characteristics of the 12.1 kton baseline configuration, given that  the covered active area is exactly the same. With these transverse dimensions every additional meter of drift length provides 1 kton increase in the active mass at a moderate additional cost.

The inner detector for the 12.1 kton active mass is built as a single active volume 60m long, 12m wide and 12m high. The active volume (see Figure~\ref{fig:DP_det1} and Figure~\ref{fig:DP_det2}) is surrounded by a vertical field cage made by a set of 60 rectangular tubular rings (tube diameter 140mm, vertical spacing 200mm).

\end{cdrfigure}

The cathode plane (on the bottom) is made by a reinforced frame, to guarantee its planarity, filled by a tubular grid (not visible in Figure~\ref{fig:DP_det2}), to allow the optical transparency for the scintillation light towards an array of 180 PMTs (1 per $4m^2$) located at the bottom of the vessel.

\end{cdrfigure}

The ionization electrons in the liquid phase drift towards the CRPs (Charge Readout Planes)  in a uniform electric field. The extraction of the electrons from the liquid to vapor phase is performed thanks to a submersed horizontal extraction grid, integrated in the  CRP structure.  Each CRP is composed of LEM/Anode Sandwiches (LAS) ($0.5m\times 0.5m$) embedded in  a mechanically reinforced frame of FR-4 and Stainless Steel.  Each sandwich includes a  LEM (Large Electron Multiplier) for the charge amplification via avalanches occurring in a micro-pattern structure in pure gas argon and an anode Printed Circuit Board (PCB) for the collection of the amplified charges on two independent orthogonal views with interleaved X and Y strips.  Thicknesses and possible biasing voltages for the different layers are indicated, as example, in Figure~\ref{fig:CRP_struct}.

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{CRP_gaps.png}
\end{cdrfigure}

The anode plane, at the top of the active volume, is made by an array of 45 independent CRP modules, $3\times3$ $m^2$ each, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CRP_unit1} and Figure~\ref{fig:CRP_unit2} Each CRP unit includes 36 ($0.5m\times 0.5m$) LAS. 

Signals in each CRP unit are collected via 3 signal feedthrough chimneys. Each chimney collects 640 readout channels and hosts at its bottom the front-end cards with the cryogenic electronics (ASIC amplifiers), just before a cold feedthrough isolating them from the ultra-pure LAr volume. The front-end cards work at a temperature of 110 K and can be removed from the top of the chimney without contaminating the LAr volume. The LEM/Anode sandwiches in the same CRP unit are interconnected with short flat cables so that each readout channel corresponds to a total strips length of 3m.
  
Each CRP unit is independently suspended  by 3 stainless steel ropes. The  vertical level of each CRP unit can then be automatically adjusted with respect to the LAr level via 3 suspension feedthroughs, electrically operated from outside. A Slow Control feedthrough + chimney, one per CRP unit, is used for the signals readout for level meters and the temperature probes and to apply the HV bias on the two sides of the LEMs  and on the extraction grid.

The extraction grid integrated in the CRP  is made by an array of X and Y oriented stainless steel wires, 0.1mm in diameter with 3.125mm pitch.  Wires, ~3 long in X and ~3m long in Y directions, have their sags minimized to ~0.1mm thanks to X and Y oriented supporting combs blades ( Figure~\ref{fig:Wires_comb}) inserted between anode planes of $1m \times 1m$ size. The array of blades penetrates the liquid close to the surface and have the additional benefit of maintaining the liquid level flat.
