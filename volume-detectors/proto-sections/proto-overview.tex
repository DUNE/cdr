\section{Overview}
\label{sec:proto-overview}


This chapter describes the prototyping strategy for the DUNE  far and near detectors and the efforts that are underway or being planned.  The efforts include:

\begin{itemize}
\item the 35-ton prototype at Fermilab
\item the single-phase DUNE prototype at CERN
\item the dual-phase LArTPC prototype known as WA105
\item prototypes for the Near Neutrino Detector (NND) and Beamline Measurement (BLM) systems
%\item The near detector Beamline Measurements prototype (for the detector described in \ref{sec:detectors-nd-ref-blm})
\end{itemize}

The single-phase LArTPC prototyping efforts, i.e., the 35-t at Fermilab and the DUNE prototype at CERN, have evolved from the plans made initially for LBNE, as described in Chapter 7 of \anxlbnefd.  At the time the LBNE document was written, the 35-t membrane cryostat had not yet been fabricated; Section~\ref{sec:proto-35t} provides a summary of the recent and near future 35-t operations.  The 1-kt prototype described in the LBNE document is no longer planned and has been replaced by the DUNE single-phase LArTPC prototype at CERN, which is summarized in Section~\ref{sec:proto-cern-single} and fully described in \anxcernproto.  The prototyping plans made for LBNE were in turn a part of a larger LArTPC detector development program at Fermilab, which is also linked to the short-baseline program at Fermilab; these connections are described in Section~\ref{sec:sbn_connect}.

The dual-phase WA105 prototype detector has evolved from the European-based design studies performed for LAGUNA-LBNO; the development background for these is summarized %provided 
in Section~\ref{sec:detectors-fd-ref-ov}.  The WA105 detector provides a full-scale implementation of a dual-phase LArTPC \fixme{check, section of a LArTPC?}, summarized below in Section~\ref{sec:proto-cern-double} and fully described in  \anxdualtdr.  A 20-t engineering prototype of WA105, also described Section~\ref{sec:detectors-fd-ref-ov}, %below, 
is planned for the immediate future.

Both the single-phase and dual-phase prototypes at CERN will be operated in a test beam and calibrated with charged particles (pion, muons, electrons). The data from the CERN
prototypes will be combined with data from other operating LArTPCs, such as those in the Fermilab short-baseline and test beam programs, and used to refine the simulations of the DUNE far detectors.  

The near detector prototyping plans described in Section~\ref{sec:proto-nd} are under development and also %expect to utilize 
include utilization of particle test beams at CERN and Fermilab.  Prototypes of certain near beamline systems \fixme{what's a near beamline system?} have already been operated in the NuMI beam at Fermilab.

The prototyping efforts provide the opportunity for the Collaboration to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for successful construction and implementation of the DUNE detectors. They  will provide guidance  %on technical concerns such as procurement strategies, %vendors, <-- part of procurement
 in areas such as procurement, construction and installation techniques, as well as on refinement of the designs and validation of cost and schedule estimates.  Operation of the %DUNE 
prototypes willprovide  opportunities to test data-taking and data-handling assumptions, and to enhance the development of data analysis tools.  %All the prototyping efforts allow the collaboration to acquire and practice the skills and knowledge needed to implement the final DUNE detectors. <--- redundant
