\section{Overview}
\label{sec:proto-overview}


This chapter describes the prototyping strategy for the DUNE near and far detectors and the efforts that are underway or being planned.  The efforts include: 

\begin{itemize}
\item The 35-ton prototype at Fermilab (described in detail in \anxlbnefd)
\item The single-phase LArTPC prototype at CERN (described in detail in \anxcernproto)
\item The dual-phase LArTPC prototype known as WA105 (described in detail in \anxdualtdr)  
\item Something for the NND  (described in detail in \fixme{??}) 
\item The Near Detector BLM prototype (described in detail in \fixme{??}) 
\end{itemize}

\fixme{Some statement about how together these prototypes will provide guidance on procurement strategies, vendors, construction and installation techniques, as well as on refinement of the design of various components, procedures and analysis techniques. (or whatever)}
