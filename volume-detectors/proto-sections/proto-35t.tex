\section{The 35-ton Prototype} 
\label{sec:proto-35t}

Please include at least one figure that illustrates the overall 35t.

Here is a sample figure: 

\begin{cdrfigure}[short]{label}{long}
%\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{file}
\end{cdrfigure}

Here is a sample reference to a figure (Figure~\ref{fig:label}).  Notice: ``fig:'' is not present in the label as written in the figure code itself.

Here is a sample table:

\begin{cdrtable}[short]{cc}{label}{long}  %The third argument (reads {cc}) can use c, l, r or p{some length} 
% but please do not include lines like “|c|l|l|”. It CAN look like {cll} or {llp{3cm}}, for instance.
Header Column1 & Header Column 2 \\ \toprowrule
Row 1 & First \\ \colhline
Row 2 & Second \\ \colhline
Row 3 & Third \\
\end{cdrtable}

Here is a sample reference to a table Table~\ref{tab:label}).  Notice: ``tab:'' is not present in the label as written in the table code itself.
