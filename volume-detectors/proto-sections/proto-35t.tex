\section{The 35-t Prototype}
\label{sec:proto-35t}

The 35-t (metric ton) LAr prototype was designed to demonstrate that a
non-evacuable membrane cryostat could satisfy the DUNE far detector
requirement that oxygen contamination of the LAr be less than 100
parts per trillion (ppt) and stably maintain that level.  In addition,
construction and operation of the 35-t cryostat has also served to
identify requirements for procurement of materials and services, to
inform procedures for construction and to inform best practices for
safe operation.  Construction and operation of the 35-t membrane
cryostat alone (without detector elements), now called ``Phase-1,''
was successfully completed in 2014.

The second phase of 35-t prototype operations (Phase-2) includes
installion and operatation of a small-scale, single-phase LArTPC and
photon detector in this cryostat.  Phase-2 focuses on the performance
of active detector elements within the LAr volume.  Phase-2 is
currently under construction and plans to take data in summer 2015.

\subsection{35-t Phase-1}

The 35-t membrane cryostat was built by the Japanese company IHI,
contracted by the LBNE project.  
Table~\ref{tab:35Tdimensions} lists the construction materials and the
dimensions for the 35-t prototype; more information can be found in~\cite{bib:membcryo1573}.

The prototype was built in Fermilab's PC-4 facility near the Liquid
Argon Purity Demonstrator (LAPD)~\cite{bib:lapdP07005} 
allowing re-use of a large portion of the LAPD
cryogenic-process equipment.  The proximity and
size (30~tons) of the LAPD vessel offers the possibility using
LAPD as a partial storage vessel for LAr if it ever becomes necessary
to empty the 35-t cryostat.

The 35-t system employs a submersible pump to move LAr from the
cryostat through the filters.  Figure~\ref{fig:35cutaway} shows a
cutaway view of the cryostat and a photograph of the interior of the
completed cryostat.

\end{cdrfigure}

The techniques of membrane cryostat construction were demonstrated to
be suitable for high-purity LArTPC service.  In particular, welding of
corrugated panels, removal of leak-checking dye penetrant and
ammonia-activated leak-detecting paints and post-construction-cleaning
methods, were tested and found to be suitable.


As was demonstrated by LAPD, initial removal of impurities within the cryostat can be
achieved by purging with gaseous argon. Accordingly, this 
was adopted for the 35-t.   Figure~\ref{fig:35TPurge} graphically shows the
first step of the purification process, removal of the ambient air.
The initial state, $t=0$, reflects the initial values for oxygen, water and
nitrogen in the ``dry air'' state.
\begin{cdrfigure}[Gas Ar Purge and Recirculation]{35TPurge}{Progress of the gas argon purge as it removes impurities  from the 35-t. The shown quantities are measured by various gas analyzers. The first stage of the purification is a process called the ``Piston Purge''.  The second stage is ``Recirculation with Filtering.'' The gap between the two steps was due to troubleshooting a leak.}

\end{cdrfigure}

Once the room-temperature, gas purge ceased to improve purity,
the cooldown and LAr-fill stage began.  A gas/liquid spray method was
used to cool the cryostat.  This generated a turbulent mixing of cold
gas in the cryostat and cooled the entire surface.  The cooldown rate
was maintained within the limits specified by the cryostat
manufacturer.  Upon completion of the cooldown, LAr was transferred
into the cryostat and purification via recirculation loop was begun.

During recirculation and purification, dedicated purity monitors were
used to measure electron lifetime, which can be translated into
equivalent oxygen contamination levels.
Figure~\ref{fig:35TElectronLifetime} shows the electron lifetime from
the start of the LAr pump operation until the end of the Phase-1 run.
In general, the electron lifetime improved as a function of pump
on-time; despite several events that spoiled the lifetime, the DUNE
electron lifetime specification ($>$2~ms) was easily achieved.

are one week periods. Equivalent purity levels are shown as dashed horizontal lines.}

\end{cdrfigure}

The 35-t Phase-1 run successfully demonstrated that there is nothing
inherent to membrane cryostat technology that would preclude achieving
the stated goals of the DUNE far detector. In addition, experience
gained in operating the 35-t system will inform future design
decisions, e.g., developing plans for replacing pumps in a way that
prevents loss of purity.  Future system designs could also avoid the
coupling of acoustical vibrations into the cryostat by locating the
pumps externally; this would have the added benefit of facilitating
maintenance and repair.

\subsection{35-t Phase-2}

Phase-2 of the 35-t prototype includes a fully operational TPC and
photon detector in the cryostat.  Commissioning of the TPC is expected
in August 2015 after TPC installation, purge, cooldown and LAr fill.
Phase-2 operation is planned as a several-month-long cosmic ray run.
External plastic scintillator paddles placed around the cryostat will
provide both the trigger for and rough position measurements of the
incoming cosmic rays.  Figure~\ref{fig:35TTPC} shows the trial
assembly of the TPC outside of the cryostat along with a model of the
TPC inside the cryostat.

Note the position of the APA, which is asymmetrically located between the CPAs (purple) and
splits the volume into one large and one very small %two separate 
drift regions.
The length of the longer one of these is close to what is proposed for the far detector.
The other has a shorter drift length due to lack of space.

The Phase-2 prototype incorporates many of the novel design elements
for the DUNE single-phase far detector described in previous sections
of this document and allows these to be tested in an operational TPC.
Some of the more important aspects are collected in
Table~\ref{tab:35TDesign}.

\end{cdrtable}

As can be seen from Table~\ref{tab:35TDesign}, successful tests of many of the new
design features will require simulation, reconstruction and analysis of 35-t data.
This will be performed using the LArSoft package, which is also used to simulate and
reconstruct data from ArgoNeuT, MicroBoone and LArIAT.
Reuse of software developed for those experiments will greatly facilitate 35-t developments;
however, the novel hardware features of the 35-t prototype necessitate new software developments, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item{code to divide the wrapped wires into as many as five individual linear segments.
A hit on a single electronic channel can, in principle, be related to a
signal on any of these segments.}
\item{``disambiguation'' code to identify which of the possible wire segments was actually responsible
for the observed hit}
\item{code for determining the start time of the event ($t_0$). Since the 35-t prototype DAQ can
run ``triggerless,'' methods are needed for finding the $t_0$ in data. Information from the external
scintillator paddles as well as the internal photon detectors can be used.}
\item{Code for ``stitching'' together track segments observed in different tracking volumes.
Since hits can come from either side of the four APAs, there are
effectively eight separate tracking volumes,
which are treated as separate TPCs.}
\end{itemize}

With these simulation and reconstruction tools in hand, ``physics''
analysis of the data can be undertaken in the areas of validation of
new detector design elements and analysis of basic LArTPC performance.
Among the highest-priority analysis tasks are:
\begin{itemize}
\item{basic detector performance: signal/noise, purity measured with tracks, track direction resolution,
photon detector light yield}
\item{measurement of distortions due to space charge and field non-uniformity}
\item{identification of different types of particles: muons, protons, neutrons, pions}
\end{itemize}

The results obtained by operating and analyzing data from the 35-t
Phase-2 prototype are expected to be very valuable in refining the
CERN single-phase prototype design, in preparation for the first
\ktadj{10} DUNE far detector module.
