\section{Connections to the Short-Baseline Program at Fermilab} 
\label{sec:proto-sbn}


The prototyping plans made by LBNE were in turn a part of a larger
LArTPC detector development program at Fermilab and elsewhere in the
U.S., which are summarized in Chapter 7 of \anxlbnefd and fully
described in the \textit{Integrated Plan for LArTPC Neutrino Detectors in the U.S}.

This detector development plan has largely been fulfilled, with an
endpoint represented by the experiments which comprise the
short-baseline program at Fermilab on the Booster Neutrino Beamline :
MicroBooNE, the Short-Baseline Near Detector, and ICARUS.
 % probably want a reference for each of those....  
Each of these detectors shares some technical elements with each other and 
the DUNE far detector prototypes, such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item cryogenic system design
\item argon purification techniques
\item cold electronics
\end{itemize}
In other aspects however the detectors are different -- in the design
details of the anode wire planes for example.  The Short-Baseline Near
Detector is most similar to DUNE detectors, having adopted the 35-ton
APA-CPA-Field Cage design.

The Fermilab LArTPC detector development program includes a
calibration detector and reconstruction software development.  The
planned calibration detector has become the Liquid Argon In A Test
Beam program (LArIAT) which has recently begun operations in the Meson
Center beamline.  The LArSoft software is a set of configurable
packages designed to reconstruct the data from any liquid argon
detector.  It is supported by the Fermilab Scientific Computing
Division and has contributors from all of the operating and planned
LArTPC experiments at Fermilab.
