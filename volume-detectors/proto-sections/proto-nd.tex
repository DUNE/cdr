\section{Near Detector Prototypes}
\label{sec:proto-nd}
Near detector prototypes are planned for both the neutrino detector and beamline measurements systems.

\subsection{Near Neutrino Detector Prototypes}
\label{sec:proto-nd-nnd}
The prototyping plan for the Fine-Grained Tracker (FGT) near neutrino
detector, as described in Section~\ref{cdrsec:detectors-nd-ref},
involves the following major steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Straw-Tube Tracking Detector (STT) Prototyping
\item ECAL Prototyping
\item MuID -- RPC Development
\item Dipole Magnet Studies
\end{itemize}

A schematic of the FGT is given in Figure~\ref{fig:STT_schematic}. The
prototyping activity for the reference design will be developed
jointly by the participating collaborators in India, with some
contributions from institutions in the U.S. or other countries.  The
prototyping work is spread over a duration of three years. The plan is
detailed below.

\subsubsection{Straw-Tube Tracking Detector}

The proposed Straw-Tube Tracking (STT) detector design
provides the central active tracking of the FGT and use straws of
1-cm diameter fabricated from an inner carbon-loaded Kapton (XC) wall
and a second aluminum-coated outer Kapton (HN) wall. The details of the
STT design are available in
Section~\ref{cdrsec:detectors-nd-ref-fgt-stt}. The prototype design
has two layers of 60 straws each.  The straws will have the
same dimensions as listed in
Section~\ref{cdrsec:detectors-nd-ref-fgt-stt}, but half the nominal
length, i.e., 1.8~m. The major milestones in the STT prototyping
are highlighted below.

%\textbf{\textit{Design and Fabrication of STT Prototype}} \\
The three-year STT R\&D and prototyping phase will start with the 3D
design of a prototype module.  This will include optimization of
parameters for the prototype assembly and validation of the mechanical
structure using Finite Element Method (FEM) techniques. This process
will be a self-feeding system with input from GEANT detector
simulations.  Figure~\ref{fig:STT_SimulationG4} shows the STT
simulation.  
The STT prototype will be fabricated and will undergo
extensive tests both in the laboratory and 
in particle beams at CERN.

\end{cdrfigure}



%\textbf{ \textit{Design and prototyping of radiators and nuclear targets}} \\
As described in Section~\ref{cdrsec:detectors-nd-ref-fgt-stt}, a key
feature of the STT is the capability to integrate a series of
nuclear targets for (anti)neutrino interactions.  The main
target is provided by the radiators that are made of thin polypropylene foils
(Figure~\ref{fig:STT_Detail}).  The design of the radiator targets has
been optimized with simulations of the Transition Radiation (TR)
with emphasis on integration into the mechanical structure of
the STT modules.  The production and design of the plastic foils was
discussed with vendors and a half-scale
(1.8~m$\times$1.8~m) prototype of the radiator targets will be produced to demonstrate
assembly, mechanical properties and overall
performance.
A preliminary design has been developed for the
pressurized Ar gas target (Figure~\ref{fig:STT_ArTargets}), based on
the use of 0.5-in diameter stainless steel tubes.
We plan to build prototypes of the pressurized Ar gas tubes to 
optimize the design of the tubes, including the tube diameter
and the possibility to use carbon-composite tubes. 
Construction of small-scale prototypes of the Ca and C targets is also planned.

\end{cdrfigure}


%\textbf{ \textit{Anode Wire Studies}} \\
The straw tube sense wires were initially proposed as 30~$\mu$m
diameter gold plated tungsten, similar to the COMPASS design. In order
to minimize the material budget of the mechanical frames used for the
STT modules, it is important to reduce the wire tension. To this end,
the prototyping includes a detailed study of the possibility of using
20-$\mu$m wires instead of the default 30-$\mu$m. The tensile strength
of these wires inside the straw tubes could affect the signal
generation over a long period due to sagging; a detailed study is in
progress.  Figure~\ref{fig:STT_WireTensionTests} shows the tension
measurement results for 20--30~$\mu$m wires using the
induced-resonance method.  The proposed tension limit on the sense
wires is 70~g.
\begin{cdrfigure}[Wire tension measurement studies (20~$\mu$m and 30~$\mu$m)]
{STT_WireTensionTests}{Wire tension measurement studies for 20~$\mu$m and 30~$\mu$m.}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{STT_WireTensionTests}
\end{cdrfigure}


%\textbf{ \textit{Test Straw Chamber}} \\
A test chamber with 48 straws of the same dimensions as those for the
FGT but with 1-m length has been built and is available for
operational studies aimed at understanding the gas flow rates and
finalizing the preamplifier selection parameters.
Figure~\ref{fig:STT_TestStrawChamber} shows a signal pulse with
Ar+CO$_2$ (80:20) gas taken with cosmic rays. The voltage versus
amplitude for one of the straws is also shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:STT_TestStrawChamber} to establish the QA/QC procedure
for the fabricated straws.
\begin{cdrfigure}[Pulse and voltage-amplitude for the test straw chamber]
{STT_TestStrawChamber}{Example pulse from the test straw chamber (left) and
measurement of voltage vs. amplitude for one of the straws in the test chamber (right).}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{STT_TestStrawChamber}
\end{cdrfigure}


%\textbf{ \textit{Front-end Electronics}} \\
We are performing tests of prototype electronics for the signal
readout.  A four-channel preamplifier has been tested with the test
chamber using a radioactive source and the signal has been recorded as
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:STT_SignalPreAmp}.
\begin{cdrfigure}[Signal from single straw using the BARC preamp and source]
{STT_SignalPreAmp}{Signal from single straw using the BARC (Bhabha Atomic Research Center) preamp and source.}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{STT_SignalPreAmp}
\end{cdrfigure}
The back-end DAQ is still being worked out and would follow the
description in Section~\ref{cdrsec:detectors-nd-ref-fgt-instrum}. At
present both CAMAC- and VME-based DAQ are available. In addition, a
$\mu$TCA-based fast DAQ has also been setup.

%\textbf{ \textit{Other Activities}} \\
Other activities are in progress. As part of the prototyping, 50 straws of 1.8~m from Lamina
Dielectrics Ltd. and 1~km of 30~$\mu$m anode wire from Luma
has been procured. The optical bench for the fabrication of the
straws has been setup.  Two pre-mixed gas bottles of Ar+CO$_2$ have been
procured. The operational gas mixture of
Xe+CO$_2$ will be added
soon. Local industry and vendors have been identified for
manufacturing nozzles, end-plugs, wire-spacers and steel
balls. Local workshops are available to fabricate the mechanical
structure to hold the straws in the prototype design and also to
fabricate a test stand for studies of efficiency and characteristics with
a radioactive source. Wire stringing, straw gluing and other tooling
setups are still to be established.


%\textbf{ \textit{Design of the Full-scale STT Modules}} \\
%We will optimize t
The final design of the STT modules will be optimized based on the
results obtained from the STT prototype and the related prototyping
activities listed above. This task includes a detailed FEM analysis to
assess the mechanical structure and the choice of final
materials. 
%The final design is intended to be ready for the fabrication of the full-scale STT detector. 



\subsubsection{ECAL Detector}

In the FGT the ECAL detector will have $4\pi$ coverage outside
the STT.  The detailed description of this
detector is given in Section~\ref{cdrsec:detectors-nd-ref-fgt-ecal}.
The ECAL prototype will be a 2~m$\times$2~m module similar to the
downstream-ECAL design.  The half-scale downstream ECAL prototype
construction, which uses Pb as the absorber and extruded scintillator
with embedded fiber as the active detector system, will involve the
following steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item procure materials (plastic scintillator bars, WLS fibers,
  SiPM, Pb sheets, etc.)
\item set up mechanism to ensure the quality of the scintillator bars,
  fibers and Pb sheets
\item set up tools for the characterization of SiPMs
\item assemble scintillator bars in an aluminum frame for a
  prototype layer formation
\item undertake R\&D for the coupling of the fiber to the SiPMs as well
  as the inserting of fiber in the scintillator
\item develop readout electronics for the prototype and set up a cosmic
  test stand with full DAQ
\item complete ECAL mechanical design 
\end{itemize}

The ECAL readout system is centered on a highly sensitive/high-gain
SiPM.  During the R\&D phase, SiPMs from Hamamatru, AdvanSiD and SiPM
developed in India by SCL will be compared.  Discussions have been
started with all the vendors.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item comparison of SiPMs from Hamamatru, AdvanSiD and SiPM developed in India by SCL
%\item discussions are already on with all the vendors
%\end{itemize}

Optimization of the ECAL detector geometry with GEANT4 simulations has
been initiated. The geometry in the current GEANT4 simulation includes
58 layers of alternating horizontal and vertical scintillator layers
per 1.75~mm Pb along the $z$-direction. In the present configuration
each scintillator layer is made of plastic scintillator bars of
dimensions 4~m$\times$2.5~cm$\times$1~cm, resulting in 160 bars per
layer, and \num{9280} scintillator bars for the downstream ECAL .
Figure~\ref{fig:ECAL_SimulationG4} shows the longitudinal view of the
electromagnetic shower in the downstream ECAL by 2~GeV
photons. Figure~\ref{fig:ECAL_detail} shows the design of the
Pb-scintillator assembly configuration for the ECAL.

{ECAL_SimulationG4}{Longitudinal view of the electromagnetic shower in
the downstream ECAL by 2 GeV photons.}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{ECAL_SimulationG4}
\end{cdrfigure}

For the construction of the prototype and for the assembly of the
actual detector a space of dimension 32~m$\times$12~m has been
identified. Construction of a class 10,000 clean room covering a
laboratory space of 12~m$\times$12~m is under consideration.
Figure~\ref{fig:ECAL_LabIITG} shows the schematic diagram of the
laboratory refurbishment plan for the ECAL R\&D and fabrication work.

\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{ECAL_LabIITG}
\end{cdrfigure}


\subsubsection{Dipole Magnet Development}

The massive dipole magnet (see Section~\ref{cdrsec:detectors-nd-ref-fgt-magnet}) for the FGT 
is critical for the particle-momentum measurements, will 
provide space for the MuID--RPC installation in the magnet steel
and will provide structural support for the FGT. 
The planned magnet prototype
includes the engineering development of the tooling and
infrastructure 
that will be used to produce one C out of the total 8 Cs of the
8.0-m long dipole.  The same C will be utilized in the final magnet
assembly. In a similar way, one of the four coils
will be assembled to establish the coil winding procedure and measure the
operating characteristics.  Field simulation work is very
advanced (see Figure~\ref{fig:Magnet_Bfield}) and the mechanical
designs are being produced.  (Steel dimensions are being optimized to house the muon
identification detectors.) Since it will be a
closed system, access to the inner detector systems is under extensive
study.


\subsubsection{MuID--RPC Detector}

Muon identification is accomplished via Bakelite Resistive Plate
Chamber (RPC) detectors.  The RPC mounting structure will be provided
by the magnet steel (on sides and ends).  Extensive R\&D for RPCs is
being applied to the prototyping of the muon identifiers. The size of
the FGT RPCs make it challenging to procure the raw material from
industry; however, an Indian company has been identified and a
large 2.4-m$\times$1.2~m RPC prototype has been assembled (see
Section~\ref{cdrsec:detectors-nd-ref-fgt-muonid}). The I-V
characteristics obtained for these RPCs are very encouraging. More
RPCs will be fabricated during the prototyping phase and will be
tested for sustained efficiency with variation in ambient parameters,
as the Bakelite is sensitive to such changes. Some of the measured
quantities are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:RPC_PrototypeTests}.  
\begin{cdrfigure}[RPC characteristics measured during the prototype development]
{RPC_PrototypeTests}{RPC characteristics measured during the prototype development.}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{RPC_PrototypeTests}
\end{cdrfigure}
The readout electronics are being developed with input from INO-ICAL
detector~\cite{1748-0221-7-10-P10003} R\&D. The standard RPC gases
will need to be replaced with safer ones for underground operation.
An initiative in this direction will be taken up during the
prototyping phase.



\subsection{Beamline Measurement Detectors Prototyping Plan}
\label{sec:proto-nd-blm}
This Section describes recent and ongoing prototyping efforts for the detectors described in Section~\ref{sec:detectors-nd-ref-blm}.


\subsubsection{Prototype Development for the Cherenkov and Ionization Detectors}
\label{subsec:proto-blm-muon-cherenkov-proto}

A prototype Cherenkov counter, along with associated fully automated
gas systems, HV systems, and data acquisition system has been
constructed and is undergoing testing in the NuMI neutrino beam's Muon
Alcove 2. In addition, three diamond detectors~\cite{ref:CERNdiamond} (from CERN)
for ionization measurements have  been installed in the alcove. 
Figure~\ref{fig:Alcove2Cherenkov} shows the prototype detectors in the
NuMI Alcove 2.
\begin{cdrfigure}[Muon gas Cherenkov counter]{Alcove2Cherenkov}
{A prototype muon gas Cherenkov detector for DUNE.
Muons travel through an L-shaped 4-inch Conflat pipe filled with a
pressurized gas. A flat mirror mirrors directs the optical photons
to a photo multiplier. The lower right inset shows the 20~bar MKS
pressure reading achieved by the Cherenkov gas system, and the inset
on the upper right shows the CERN/Cividec diamond detectors mounted to the Cherenkov housing.}
\includegraphics[width=6.in]{Alcove2Cherenkov}
\end{cdrfigure}

The counter has an automated gas system with an adjustable % settable 
pressure that
ranges from vacuum to 20~atm, corresponding to muon Cherenkov
thresholds of 200~GeV/c and 1~GeV/c, respectively. When operated at
vacuum, a photomultiplier tube (PMT) registers all background light unrelated to the gas,
e.g., transition radiation and light from particles hitting the window and
PMT glass.  These contributions are observed to be very small relative
to the coherent, directional Cherenkov light.

The counter is constructed with a 1-m long radiator section as shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:CherenkovCounterDetail} . A 20-foot extension
allows the reflected Cherenkov light to travel to a sapphire pressure
window viewed by a PMT.
\begin{cdrfigure}[Muon gas Cherenkov counter detail]{CherenkovCounterDetail}
{A prototype muon gas Cherenkov detector for DUNE.  }
\includegraphics[width=6.in]{CherenkovCounterDetail.pdf}
\end{cdrfigure}


The prototype has been fully integrated into NuMI operations and
real-time waveforms can be viewed online as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:MuonDetectorWaveforms}.
\begin{cdrfigure}[Muon detector waveforms]{MuonDetectorWaveforms}
{The real-time display of the muon detector prototypes in operation
on the NuMI beam line. The top two panels are the Cherenkov counter
and CERN diamond detector. The signals are
transmitted through low-loss heliax cable, then the waveform
is digitized at 2.5~GHz with a 12-bit dynamic range, and is
recorded onto disk storage for analysis. The signal from the
muons is contained in the short beam pulse ``buckets'' created
by the accelerator RF structure. The fast timing allows the
prompt muon signal to be easily separated from potential backgrounds
such as stopped-muon decays, beta decays, and neutrons.}
\includegraphics[width=5in]{MuonDetectorWaveforms}
\end{cdrfigure}
The top panel shows the waveform from the Cherenkov counter at 2~atm
gas pressure, which corresponds to a muon momentum threshold of
3~GeV/c. The second panel shows the waveform from a 9~mm$\times$9~mm
diamond detector mounted to the front flange of the Cherenkov radiator
section, as shown in the inset of Figure~\ref{fig:Alcove2Cherenkov}.

The extracted NuMI proton beam produces a signal in the Resistive Wall
Monitor (RWM) that is recorded with an identical digitizer. This allows a direct,
bucket-by-bucket (individual proton pulses) comparison of the proton
current onto the NuMI primary proton target. The muons are measured
after the absorber with a 400-ps time resolution.

\subsubsection{Prototype Development of the Stopped-Muon Counters}

Prototype development activity for the Michel-electron detectors will
be divided into studies of (1) the rate of particles and the radiation environment where
the detectors will be located, and (2) development of the counters
themselves.

The radiation environment will be studied with Monte Carlo
simulation and measurement from initial prototype detectors
in the NuMI muon alcoves~\cite{ref:NuMIBeamMonitors}.
The prototypes will be installed in the alcoves in 2016 and 2017.
Studies will be performed to determine if the photon sensors
can survive the radiation environment at the location of the Michel
detector. If the sensors can survive, they can be attached directly to
the Cherenkov medium; if not, optical guides will have to bring the
light to a lower-radiation area, to the side of the beam. Potential
radiation damage to the Cherenkov radiator itself will also be
studied.

The detector design will focus on selecting radiator and shielding
material, photon-detection technology and control/readout
hardware. Possible radiators include ones that use aerogel (these may be designed to
be replaced periodically) and ones that use flowing liquids such as H$_2$O or
mineral oil. Long-timescale saturation from the very high-rate
environment of the beam spill could affect the photon-counting
devices~\cite{ref:HighRateCounting}. Thus, it will likely be necessary
to design fast-switching, high-voltage circuits that turn on the
photon counters in the first few microseconds after the spill is
over. A similar system was developed in the 1990s for the Brookhaven
Muon (g-2) Experiment~\cite{ref:G2} .

%\textbf{ \textit{Current Prototyping Activities}} \\
A second set of muon detectors, the final 
%\fixme{really want to say `final'?i - yes} 
DUNE design, are being
constructed at this time (2015). They are being installed directly
behind the NuMI proton beam dump (Muon Alcove 1), mounted on a movable stand which has undergone an engineering
review at Fermilab. 
%
The entire setup, detectors and stand, will be
suitable for use in the DUNE beam. The higher-radiation environment of Alcove 1 is more representative %similar 
than Alcove 2 of the conditions in the eventual DUNE installation, and will 
allow a more accurate calibration in the NuMI
beam. The setup will be eventually transferred the DUNE Absorber Hall.
