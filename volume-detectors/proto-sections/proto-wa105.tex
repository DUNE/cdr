\section{The WA105 Dual-Phase Demonstrator}
\label{sec:proto-cern-double}

 In the recent years, two consecutive FP7 Design Studies (LAGUNA/LAGUNA-LBNO) have led to the development of a conceptual design (fully engineered and costed) for a 20-kt/50-kt GLACIER-type underground neutrino detector. In these studies, an underground implementation has been assumed {\textit{ab initio}
and such constraints have been important and taken into account in design choices. The LAGUNA-LBNO design study, completed in August 2014, has produced many technological developments focused on the construction of  large and affordable liquid argon underground detectors addressing the complete investigation of three-flavor neutrino oscillations and the determination of their still unknown parameters. 
%
These detectors will be %as well 
very powerful for important non-beam studies as well, such as proton decay, atmospheric neutrinos and supernova neutrinos. 

The WA105 experiment, approved in 2013, is designed to provide a full-scale demonstration of these technological developments. It will also be
exposed to a beam of charged hadrons/electrons/muons from 0.5 to 20 GeV/c in order to
characterize the detector response to hadronic and electromagnetic showers. %being the detector 
 A detailed description of the experiment is available in the Technical Design Report of 2014~\cite{WA105_TDR} and an 
 up-to-date picture of the technical developments in WA105 can be found in the Status Report Document submitted to the SPSC CERN committee in  March 2015~\cite{WA105_SREP}. These developments form %are also at 
 the basis of the Alternative Far Detector design for DUNE, described in Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-fd-alt}.
 % and are consequently described in the related sections.

The WA105 demonstrator is a dual-phase LArTPC with an active volume of $6\times 6\times 6$ $m^3$. 
\fixme{why not quote fiducial?} 
These dimensions are motivated by the  $4\times 4$~m$^2$ Charge Readout Plane (CPR) units that are the  basic readout components of the large-scale LAGUNA/LBNO 
20 -- 50-kt detectors.
%
The $6\times6$~m$^3$ \fixme{was squared, I changed to cubed} active volume is consistent with a fiducial volume that accommodates the CPR size and provides %corresponding to that readout unit and with a 
full containment of hadronic showers.
%
Surface operation prohibits drift lengths above 6~m. The footprint of the active volume corresponds to 1:20 of the surface of the LBNO 20-kt detector. The active volume contains about 300 tons of LAr. The important parameters of the detector are presented in Table~\ref{tab:demo_para} and Figures~\ref{fig:6by6_open}~\ref{fig:6by6_plan} and~\ref{fig:6by6_vert} provide a 3D drawing and two cut views.

The dual-phase LArTPC design drifts % is based on the vertical drift of 
the ionization electrons vertically in the LAr in a uniform electric field up to the liquid-vapor interface, where they are extracted from the liquid into the gas phase (GAr) by %thanks to 
a higher field provided by a submersed grid. 
%
In the GAr, a charge-readout system described in Section~\ref{sec:detectors-fd-alt-chg-readout}, called a Charge Readout Plane (CRP), performs charge extraction, multiplication and collection. \fixme{Is this sufficient? Are they exactly the same?}
%
The drift path in the WA105 demonstrator reaches 6~m, and %the detector is foreseen to work with 
a drift field of 0.5~kV/cm and 1~kV/cm is planned, corresponding to a cathode voltage of -300~kV and -600~kV, respectively. The CRP has an active surface of 36 $m^2$, subdivided into strips of 3.125-mm pitch and 3-m length, 
for a total of \num{7680} readout channels.

%In the GAr, the electrons are then amplified %in the GAr thanks to avalanches occurring in micro-pattern detector called LEM (Large Electron Multiplier) and collected on a 2D anode made withe a printed circuit board. The sandwich structure composed by the LEM the Anode and the extraction grid is the so called Charge Readout Plane. The gain provided by the amplification in gas allows for the compensation of the charge attenuation along long drift paths and to achieve a S/N greater than 100 for minimum ionizing particles over 12m drift path.The drift path in the WA105 demonstrator reaches 6 m, the detector is foreseen to work with a drift field of 0.5 kV/cm and 1 kV/cm, corresponding to a voltage applied to the cathode respectively of -300kV and -600 kV. The CRP has an active surface of 36 $m^2$ subdivided in strips of 3.125 mm pitch and 3 m length for a total of 7680 readout channels.

The WA105 demonstrator is intended to demonstrate all the techniques developed for the 20 and 50-kt LBNO detectors, in particular

\begin{itemize}
\item{tank construction technique based on the LNG industry with non-evacuated vessel}
\item{purification system}
\item{long drift}
\item{HV system 300--600~kV, large hanging field cage}
\item{large area double-phase charge readout}
\item{accessible cryogenic front-end electronics and cheap DAQ electronics}
\item{long-term stability of UV light readout}
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, the $6\times 6\times 6$ $m^3$ demonstrator exposed to the test beam promises a rich physics program of

\begin{itemize}
\item{assessing the detector performance in reconstructing hadronic showers; the most demanding task in neutrino interactions}
\item{measurements in hadronic and electromagnetic calorimetry and PID performance}
\item{full-scale software development, simulation and reconstruction}
\item{collection of high-statistic hadronic interaction samples, with unprecedented granularity and resolution for the study of hadronic interactions and nuclear effects}
\item{assessment of the impact on the physics capabilities of the dual-phase versus %better detector performance 
single-phase performance, in particular: high S/N, 3-mm pitch, absence of materials in long drift space, two collection views, no ambiguities}
\item{study of the systematics for the long-baseline experiment related to the reconstruction of the hadronic system (resolution and energy scale), electron-identification efficiencies and $\pi^0$ rejection. 
\item particles' $dE/dx$ identification for proton decay}
\end{itemize}

The $6\times 6\times 6$ $m^3$  WA105 detector is expected to start data taking in 2018 in the extension of the EHN1 Hall, currently under construction at CERN. %All 
The detector components are in an advanced state of design/prototyping, or preproduction. Since the submission of the TDR in 2014, the completion of the WA105 detector design and the preparation of its construction have been progressing very quickly.  At present, technical design details are benefitting from the implementation of a 20-t  ($3\times3\times1$ $m^3$)  prototype setup, which is \fixme{which incorporates a readout unit of the minimum size possible for use in
a DUNE far detector module?}  the minimal size of a readout unit in the final far detector.  Activity towards construction of this 20-t prototype has %allowed 
so far resulted in %a first overview of the complete system integration, \fixme{what does that mean? Overview on paper?} including:  
production of fully engineered prototype versions of many detector parts including %all 
installation details and ancillary services; establishment of the Quality Assessment (QA) procedures for the construction, installation and commissioning chains; establishment of  the procurement processes for the major detector components; and validation of the cost and schedule estimates for WA105.  The  $3\times3\times1$ $m^3$ 20-t prototype  represents a technical \textit{playground} and integration exercise to accelerate the design, procurement, QA and commissioning activities needed for the  $6\times 6\times6$-m$^3$ detector.  In particular, a complete procedure for the construction of tanks based on the GTT-licensed corrugated membrane technology has been set up with CERN and a full chain for the procurement, processing, assembly and commissioning of the LEM detectors and of the anodes had been also implemented.
