\section{The Photon Detection System}
\label{sec:detectors-fd-ref-pd}

The scope of the photon detector section includes the design,
procurement, fabrication, testing, delivery and installation of all
the systems and components that comprise it:  

\begin{itemize}
\item wavelength-shifting wave-guides
\item silicon photo-multipliers (SiPMs)
\item readout electronics
\item related infrastructure (frames, mounting boards, etc...)
\end{itemize}

The design presented here meets the required performance for light
collection for the DUNE far detector. The most significant
requirements include determination of t$_0$ of an event relative to
the TPC, and sufficient light collection efficiency to allow
triggering on SN neutrinos with energies as low as 20~MeV.  

Please include at least one figure (a schematic) that illustrates how this piece fits into the overall
detector.

Please include at least one figure that illustrates the overall PD system.

Here is a sample figure: 

\begin{cdrfigure}[short]{label}{long}
%\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{file}
\end{cdrfigure}

Here is a sample reference to a figure (Figure~\ref{fig:label}).  Notice: ``fig:'' is not present in the label as written in the figure code itself.

Here is a sample table:

\begin{cdrtable}[short]{cc}{label}{long}  %The third argument (reads {cc}) can use c, l, r or p{some length} 
% but please do not include lines like “|c|l|l|”. It CAN look like {cll} or {llp{3cm}}, for instance.
Header Column1 & Header Column 2 \\ \toprowrule
Row 1 & First \\ \colhline
Row 2 & Second \\ \colhline
Row 3 & Third \\
\end{cdrtable}

Here is a sample reference to a table Table~\ref{tab:label}).  Notice: ``tab:'' is not present in the label as written in the table code itself.
