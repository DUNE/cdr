\section{The Time Projection Chamber (TPC)} 
\label{sec:detectors-fd-ref-tpc}

\subsection{Overview}

The scope of the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) subsystem includes the
design, procurement, fabrication, testing, delivery of anode plane
assemblies (APAs), cathode plane assemblies (CPAs), field cage, and
the cathode high voltage system.

The Time Projection Chamber is an active detector element of each DUNE
far detector. It is located inside the cryostat vessel and is
completely submerged in liquid argon at 88~K. The TPC consists of
alternating anode plane assemblies (APAs) and cathode plane assemblies
(CPAs), with field-cage modules enclosing the four open sides between
the anode and cathode planes.  When proper bias voltages are applied
to the APAs and CPAs, a uniform electric field is created in volume
between the anode and cathode planes. A charged particle traversing
this volume leaves a trail of ionization in the ultra-pure liquid
argon.  The electrons drift toward the anode wire planes, inducing
electric current signals in the front-end electronic circuits
connected to the sensing wires.  The current signal waveforms from all
sensing wires are amplified and digitized by the front-end
electronics, and transmitted through cold cables and feedthroughs to
the data acquisition system outside of the cryostat.




The TPC active volume (Figure~\ref{fig:tpc-xsect1}) is 12~m high,
14.5~m wide and 58~m long in the beam direction.  
\begin{cdrfigure}[Cross section of the TPC inside the cryostat]{tpc-xsect1}
{Cross sections of the LBNE 5~kt TPC (left) vs. the DUNE 10~kt TPC (right).  
The exchange of the APA and CPA positions significantly reduces the energy 
stored in the TPC by eliminating the two ground facing cathode planes. 
This allows an increase in the detector's fiducial volume with the same cryostat.  
The length of the DUNE TPC is  58~m along the direction of the neutrino beam (into the page).}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{tpc_xsection_lbne_dune.pdf}
\end{cdrfigure}
Its three rows of APA planes interleaved with two rows of CPA planes
are oriented vertically, with the planes parallel to the beamline. The
electric field is applied perpendicular to the planes.  The maximum
electron-drift distance between a cathode and an adjacent anode is
3.6~m. This requires a $-$180~kV bias voltage on the cathode plane to
reach the 500~V/cm nominal drift field. The anode plane assemblies are
2.3~m wide and 6~m high. Two 6~m modules are stacked vertically to
instrument the 12~m active depth. In each row, 25 such stacks are
placed edge-to-edge along the beam direction, forming the 58~m active
length of the detector.  Each CPA has the same width, but half the
height ($\sim$3~m) as an APA, for ease of assembly and transportation.
Four CPAs will be stacked vertically to form the full 12~m active
height.  Each cryostat houses a total of 150~APAs and 200~CPAs.  Each
facing pair of cathode and anode rows is surrounded by a ``field
cage,'' assembled from panels of FR-4 glass-reinforced epoxy laminate
sheets with parallel copper strips connected to resistive divider
networks.  The entire TPC is suspended from 5 mounting rails under the
cryostat ceiling (see Figure~\ref{fig:tpc-floor-view}).
\begin{cdrfigure}[A view of the partial assembled TPC]{tpc-floor-view}
{A view of the partially installed TPC inside the membrane cryostat.

Some of the field cage modules are in their folded position against the cathode.}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{tpc_floor_view.png}
\end{cdrfigure}

The units of construction of the active detector are the APAs, CPAs,
and field cage modules. These are modular elements of a size optimized
so as to simplify the manufacture, satisfy the commercial highway and
underground transport requirements, and facilitate handling and the
speedy installation in the cryostat.  Each element will be fully
tested in LN$_2$ (or LAr) at the assembly site, again at the far
detector site before installation, and finally will be monitored
continuously during and after installation to detect any failures.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\subsection{Anode Plane Assemblies (APA)}
\label{subsec:fd-ref-apa}

The APAs are 2.3~m wide, 6.3~m high, and 12~cm thick. The height is
chosen for fabrication purposes and compatibility with underground
transport limitations. The 2.3~m width is set to fit in a standard
HiCube container for storage and transport with sufficient shock
absorbers and clearances.  Each APA is constructed from a framework of
light-weight, stainless-steel rectangular tubing, with four layers of
wires wrapped on each side of the frame. The front-end electronics
boards are mounted on one end of the wire frame and protected by a
metal enclosure.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  
\subsubsection{Wire Planes}
\label{subsec:fd-ref-wireplanes}

Wire of 150~$\mu$m diameter copper beryllium (CuBe) alloy is used on the
APAs for high tensile strength, good electrical conductivity,
excellent solder-ability and its thermal-expansion coefficient
compatible with that of the stainless-steel frame.  The wires will be
epoxied to fiberglass wire bonding boards and then soldered to copper
traces on the boards for electrical connections.

On each APA, four planes of wires cover each side of a frame (the
``wire frame'') as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tpc-wire-frame-xsect}.
\begin{cdrfigure}[Illustration of the APA wire wrapping scheme]{tpc-wire-frame-xsect}{Illustration of the APA wire wrapping scheme, and three cross sectional views.}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{tpc_apa_cross_sections}
\end{cdrfigure}
These four planes of wires are labeled, in order from the outside in:
G (for grid), U, V and X.  Table~\ref{tab:wire-parameters} summarizes
the key parameters of each of the wire planes.  
\begin{cdrtable}[Wire parameters.]
  {llrrrr}{wire-parameters} {Parameters of the four planes of wires on an APA}
  
    {\bf Label} & {\bf Function} & {\bf Orientation} & {\bf Pitch } & {\bf Number } & {\bf Bias Voltage}  		\cr 
      			&						& (from vertical) 		& {(mm)}   	&   			& {(volt)} 	\cr \hline
    G    		& Shield/grid plane 			&0$^\circ$  			& 4.79		& 960 		& $-$665   	\cr \hline
    V            	&  1$^{st}$ induction plane 	& +35.7$^\circ$  		& 4.67		&  800  		& $-$370 	\cr \hline
    U            	&  2$^{nd}$ induction plane	& $-$35.7$^\circ$  	& 4.67	 	&  800  		& 0 			\cr \hline
    X            	&  Collection plane			& 0$^\circ$ 			& 4.79 		&  960  		& +820 		\cr \hline

\end{cdrtable}
The distance between wire planes is 4.76~mm (3/16", a standard printed
circuit board thickness).  Each wire plane is biased to a particular
voltage such that the ionization electrons from charged particle
tracks will drift past the first 3 wire planes and be completely
collected by the last (X) wire plane.  The V wires are DC-coupled to
the readout electronics to minimize the maximum voltage on the other
wire planes.  A grounded mesh plane with good optical transparency,
located 4.8~mm behind the collection plane, prevents the electric
field around this set of wires from being distorted by the metal frame
structure and the wires on the opposite side of the frame. It also
shields the sensing wires from potential EM interference from the
silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) on the photon detectors, mounted
within the frame.  Each wire on the U,V and X planes is connected to a
front-end readout channel. The Grid plane wires are not read out, but
serve the important purpose of shielding the U wires from responding
to distant moving charges. The total number of readout channels in an
APA is 2560, for a total of 384,000 in each cryostat.

The wires on the two induction planes (U and V) are wrapped in a
helical pattern around the long edges of the wire frame
(Figure~\ref{fig:tpc-wire-frame-xsect}a). This technique makes it
possible to place readout electronics only at one short edge of a wire
frame, and allows tiling of the APAs on the other three sides with
minimal dead space ($\sim$1.3\% of active area).  Although wires on
both induction planes are sensitive to tracks on both sides of an APA,
the vertical collection plane wires are only sensitive to one side,
therefore able to resolve this ambiguity.  The upper APAs in the
cryostat will have their readouts at the top edge of the frame (as
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tpc-wire-frame-xsect}), while the lower APAs
will mount their electronics at the bottom edge.  These readout
electronics are located outside of the TPC active volume.  On the
readout end of an APA, 20 sets of front-end readout boards with 128
channels each (40U+40V+48X) are distributed on both sides of the APA,
reading out the 2560 sense wires.

With the APA length and width constrained by transportation
limitations, the angles on the induction plane wires are chosen so
that they wrap less than one full revolution around the APA.  This
avoids an ambiguity problem where three wires from three readout
planes intersect more than once on an APA face.  Precise values of
wire angle and wire pitch (see Table~\ref{tab:wire-parameters}) were
chosen to give an integral number of wires across the boards at the
electronics end of the APA as well as an integral number of wire slots
in the boards along the sides of the APA.  Preliminary
study\cite{wire-orientation} has shown that this wire layout meets the
physics requirements.

The APAs facing the cryostat walls are sensitive on both sides, just
like those in the middle of the TPC.  However, the negative bias
voltage on their outer grid planes prevents any electrons drifting
from the cryostat walls toward the sensing wires.  The electronics for
the outer X wire plane can be eliminated to save cost.  Or, we can
utilize these double sided APAs by adding another plane of cathode
with a small negative bias between the cryostat wall and the APAs to
form a very shallow veto region.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{APA Frame}
\label{subsec:fd-ref-apaframes}

At the nominal wire tension of 5~N, the total of 3520 wires exert a
force of $\sim$7.0~kN/m on the short edges of the APA, and a
$\sim$1.5~kN/m force on the long edges. The wire frame must be able to
withstand the wire tension with a minimal distortion, while minimizing
the thickness of the frame to reduce the resulting dead space. The
wire frame is constructed from all stainless-steel tubes welded in a
jig.  Structural analysis has shown that the maximum distortion of the
frame due to wire tension is less than 0.5~mm. The total mass of a
bare frame is $\sim$260~kg.

%% Lengthwise buckling is not an issue, both because of the strength of the frame and because the wires are maintained at an approximately uniform distance from the frame by periodic comb-like structures.

All tube sections are vented to prevent the creation of trapped
volumes. The three long tubes have slots cut in them so the photon
detectors can be inserted into the APAs after the wires are installed.
The two long outer members of the frame are open-ended, so the photon
detector cables can be threaded through them to reach the signal
feedthroughs on the cryostat roof.  These long tubes can potentially
be used to carry signal and power cables from the bottom APAs cold
electronics boards to the signal feedthroughs as well.  Compared with
running the middle bottom APA charge readout cables on the floor and
then up the wall, this could significantly reduce the cable length for
these APAs.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Wire Bonding and Support on an APA}
\label{subsec:fd-ref-wirewrap}


The wire bonding boards physically anchor the wires at the edges of an
APA, and also are the interface between the wires and the cold
electronics at the readout end of the APA.  The four planes of wires
are attached to their respective wire bonding boards through a
combination of epoxy and solder. During winding of the X layer onto
the APA the wires are placed across the top surface of the X wire
board. The wires are then glued down with a strip of epoxy at the
leading edge of the board.  After the epoxy has cured, the wires are
soldered onto the copper pads under each wire, and then the wires are
cut beyond the pads. The V, U and G planes are attached on top of the
X boards and similarly populated with wires, one layer at a time. An
array of pins is pushed through holes in the stack of wire bonding
boards, making electrical connections between the wires and the
capacitor-resistor (or CR) board, which is located between the wire
boards and the front end electronics boards.  The CR boards distribute
the bias voltages to each wire through current limiting 20~M$\Omega$
resistors, and bring the charge signal through high voltage AC
coupling capacitors to the cold electronics.

These readout boards, as described in
Section~\ref{sec:detectors-fd-ref-ce}, generate an estimated
$\sim$160~W of heat per APA which may produce a small quantity of
argon bubbles.  Stainless-steel covers are placed over the readout
boards to contain the bubbles and direct them to the gas volume of the
cryostat. This is particularly important for the bottom APAs where the
bubbles must be contained and funneled through the vertical hollow
frame members to the top of the cryostat to prevent the bubbles
entering the TPC active volume.

Comb-like wire support structures (see Figure~2.9 in \anxlbnefd) are
located on each of the 4 cross beams so that the longitudinal wires
are supported every 1.2~m and the angled wires about every 1.5~m while
introducing only millimeter-scale dead regions. The support structure
is composed of strips of thin G10 sheet, with notches machined at
correct intervals.  These wire supports play a key role in minimizing
wire deflection due to gravity and electrostatic force, enabling the
use of a moderate wire tension and reducing the risk of wire breakage.
They also maintain the correct wire pitch and wire plane separation
even if the APA frame has a small amount of twist and warp.  If a wire
breaks after installation, these intermediate wire support will limit
the movement of the broken wire such that it will not travel too far
into the drift volume and making contact to the field cage.  To
further reduce the risk and impact of a broken wire, a new wire
support scheme is being developed that can be applied to the outer
wire planes near the bottom of the TPC to prevent a broken wire from
contacting the field cage.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Wire-Winding Machines}
\label{subsec:fd-ref-wirewinding}

A winding machine will be constructed to lay the 3520 wires onto each
APA. It has sufficient versatility that the same mechanism can wind
both the angled and the longitudinal layers.
 
Its working concepts are illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:tpc-winding-machine}.
\begin{cdrfigure}[Winding machine concepts]{tpc-winding-machine}
{Illustration of the wire winding machine concept.  The tensioner 
head is passed from one side of the APA to the other as it is moved 
around the APA to wind wire onto the APA frame.  The horizontal/vertical 
positioning systems on each side of the APA are made of commercial linear motion components. }
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{tpc_apa_winding_machine.png}
\end{cdrfigure}
The wire tensioner is a self-contained unit that includes the wire
spool.  It is designed so that correct wire tension is maintained
independent of the wire feed rate and direction.  The APA is held off
the ground by a couple posts, with one of its long edges down.  There
are X-Y positioners on either side of the APA; the tensioner is moved
across the face of the APA by one of these positioners -- unspooling
tensioned wire as it moves.  When the tensioner arrives at the edge of
the APA it is passed across to the positioner on the other side of APA
while placing the wire into the appropriate slots of the edge
boards. In this way the entire layer of wire can be placed on the
frame.

Although a large part of an entire plane of wires can be wound in one
continuous process, a more fault-tolerant procedure would be to pause
the winding machine periodically and solder the last wire. This
intermediate soldering step will prevent the unraveling of a large
section due to an accidental broken wire.  An automatic soldering
robot will solder the wire ends after the wires have been laid down on
the APA. A wire-tension measuring device will scan the newly placed
wires and record the wire tension of each wire. Any wires with
abnormal tension will be replaced manually.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Cathode Plane Assemblies}
\label{subsec:fd-ref-cpa}

There are 2 cathode planes in each detector module.  Each plane is
tiled from a 4 unit high by 25 unit wide array of cathode plane
assemblies (CPAs). Figure~\ref{fig:tpc-cathode-model} shows the
building blocks of a cathode plane.  
\begin{cdrfigure}[Conceptual design of the cathode plane assembly]
{tpc-cathode-model}{Conceptual design of the different cathode plane 
components near a corner of a cathode wall.  Two flavors of CPAs (outer 
and inner unit) make up the entire wall of a cathode plane, terminated 
at both ends by the end pieces (cyan colored).  A high voltage receptacle 
(orange) connects with the HV feedthrough from the cryostat ceiling. Each 
CPA is roughly 2.3~m wide by 3~m tall.}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{tpc_cpa_components}
\end{cdrfigure}
Each CPA is 2.3~m wide (identical to the APA width) and 3~m tall (half
of APA height) for ease of fabrication, assembly and handling.  Each
CPA is made of a stainless-steel framework, with panels of solid
stainless steel sheets mounted between the from openings.  Along each
vertical column of the 4 CPAs, there are two slightly different
versions: the outer CPAs (top and bottom rows ), and the inner CPAs
(2$^{nd}$ and 3$^{rd}$ rows).  The inner CPAs use all rectangular tubes for the
frame structure, while the outer CPAs use 5~cm OD round tubes on the
outside edge of the CPA facing the floor or ceiling of the cryostat to
minimize the surface electric field.  Two sets of field shaping end
pieces are installed at the two ends of a CPA wall to properly
terminate the cathode wall with rounded edges.  All CPAs are suspended
from the ceiling using G10 hangers under fiberglass rails to insulate
the CPAs from the cryostat.

A recent design decision exchanged the positions of the CPAs and APAs
in the detector, placing the APAs adjacent to the cryostat wall
instead of the CPAs as in the LBNE reference design.  This change
reduces the stored energy on each cathode plane by about 60\%.
Nevertheless, due to the enormous area of the stainless steel cathode
plane, there is still nearly 100~Joules of energy when biased at
180~kV, risking physical damage to the thin membrane structure as well
as the CPA structure in the event of a high voltage discharge.  In
addition, in such an event, a huge voltage swing could occur on the
cathode plane in tens of nanoseconds, injecting a charge pulse to the
sensing wires with a large peak current that could damage the
front-end electronics.

To mitigate this risk, analysis of the electrical properties of the
cathode has been carried out with a goal of developing a cathode
design that will substantially slow down the total energy release in
case of a discharge.  The best solution appears to be replacing the
metallic cathode structure with non-conductive materials with a robust
and highly resistive surface coating.  There are many choices of the
resistive/anti-static coating, as well as commercially produced
anti-static sheet materials.  Studies are underway to identify a
suitable coating and base material for this application.  Since the
electrical current feeding the field cage resistive dividers is
supplied through the cathode, a special current distribution feature
must be designed to minimize voltage drop along this 58~m long, highly
resistive structure.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Field Cage}
\label{subsec:fd-ref-fieldcage}

In the TPC each pair of facing cathode and anode rows forms an
electron-drift region. A field cage must completely surround the four
open sides of this region to provide the necessary boundary conditions
to ensure a uniform electric field within, unaffected by the presence
of the cryostat walls.


Each 10-kt detector module requires $\sim$2000~m$^2$ of field
cage coverage. In the current reference design, the field cages are
constructed using multiple copper-clad FR-4 sheets reinforced with
fiber glass I-beams to form modules of 2.3~m $\times$ 3.6~m in
size. Parallel copper strips are etched on the FR-4 sheets using
standard printed circuit board fabrication technique. Strips are
biased at appropriate voltages provided by a resistive-divider
network. These strips create a linear electric-potential gradient in
the LAr, ensuring a uniform drift field in the TPC active volume.
Simulations have shown that the drift-field non-uniformity quickly
drops to about 1\%, roughly a strip pitch away from the field-cage
surface.

Since the field cage completely encloses the TPC drift region on four
sides, while the solid cathodes blocks the remaining two, the field
cage sheets must be perforated to allow liquid argon recirculation in
the middle 1/3 of the TPC volume. The ``transparency'' of the
perforation will be determined by a detailed LAr computerized fluid
dynamic (CFD) study.

The resistor-divider network will be soldered directly onto the
field-cage panels. Multiple resistors will be connected in parallel
between any two taps of the divider, in order to provide fault
tolerance. One end of the divider chain is connected directly to the
cathode, while the other end is connected to ground at the APA through
resistors of the appropriate value.  It is envisioned that a pair of
field cage modules are pre-attached to the outer CPA modules through
hinges, and the field cage modules can be rotated into their final
position during installation, or folded back if aisle access is needed
(see Figure~\ref{fig:tpc-floor-view}).  In additional to the resistor
network, surge suppressors such as varistors or gas discharge tubes
will be installed between each field cage strips to avoid an
over-voltage condition occurring between field cage electrodes and the
cathode in a high voltage discharge.

The major challenge of this field cage design is to minimize the
electric field exposed to the liquid argon near the thin copper
strips.  One solution is to cover all copper edges with a thick layer
of solder mask (an acrylic based polymer with a high dielectric
strength) as part of the standard PCB fabrication process.  This
construction is currently being implemented in the 35-t TPC (see
Sec~7.5 of \anxlbnefd).  Figure~\ref{fig:tpc-field-cage} shows a
section of the partially constructed field cage.  
\begin{cdrfigure}[35-t field cage]{tpc-field-cage}{A corner of the 35-t TPC 
field cage as it is being constructed}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{tpc_fca_35t.jpg}
\end{cdrfigure}
The 35-t TPC test results will be evaluated to determine if this
technique is suitable for the much larger far detector.
 
In the meantime, alternate concepts are being actively developed to
further minimize the electric field on the field cage.  One example is
to apply a very high resistive coating on the outside surface of the
field cage such that the surface potential distributes uniformly
across the gaps between conductors therefore eliminates the high field
region near the conductor edges.  The challenge here is how to
ventilate this field cage surface without significantly increasing the
field at the edge of perforation.  Another concept is to use
roll-formed metal profiles as the field cage electrodes supported by
insulating beams.  These profiles have large edge radii that makes
their surface electric field relatively low, which makes it possible
to be placed even closer to the cryostat walls to improve the
efficiency in LAr use.  One particular profile is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:tpc-field-cage-roll-form}.  
\begin{cdrfigure}[FCA with roll-formed metal profile]{tpc-field-cage-roll-form}
{Left: electrostatic simulation of a field cage design that uses roll-formed 
metal profiles as the field cage electrodes.  Right: a conceptual design of a 
field cage module using this profile.}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{tpc_fca_rollform.png}
\end{cdrfigure}
With only a 20~cm distance
away from a ground plane, the electric field on the field cage is
still under 12~kV/cm.  The ends of the profiles still have high
electric field.  A possible solution is to cover the ends with UHMW
polyethylene caps.  This design may also cost significantly less than
the reference design with PCBs.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{High Voltage Components}  
\label{subsec:fd-ref-hv}
   
The two cathode planes are biased at $-$180~kV to provide the required
500~V/cm drift field. Each cathode plane will be powered by a
dedicated HV power supply through an RC filter and feedthrough.

The power supplies for the TPC cathode planes must be able to provide
$-$200~kV at 1~mA current. The output voltage ripple must not
introduce more than 10\% of the equivalent thermal noise from the
front-end electronics.  The power supplies must be programmable to
trip (shutdown) their output at a certain current limit.  During power
on and off, including output loss (for any reason), the voltage ramp
rate at the feedthrough must be controllable to prevent damage to the
in-vessel electronics through excess charge injection.  High-voltage
feedthroughs must be able to withstand $-$250~kV at their center
conductors in 1~atm argon gas environment when terminated in liquid
argon.


The current candidate for the high-voltage power supplies is the
Heinzinger PNC{\it hp} series, which has the lowest output ripple
specification.  Additional filtering of the voltage ripples is done
through the intrinsic HV cable capacitance and series resistors
installed inside the filter box. Established techniques and practices
will be implemented to eliminate micro-discharges and minimize
unwanted energy transfer in case of an HV breakdown.
  
To ensure safe and reliable operation, the feedthroughs will be tested
at a much higher voltage than expected in routine operation
($\sim$250~kV) in liquid argon. The feedthroughs will be mounted on
the ceiling of the cryostat, their cold ends reaching through the gas
ullage space and submerging into the liquid argon. The center
conductor on the cold side of a feedthrough will be insulated and
shielded by a grounded shroud at least 50~cm below the surface of the
liquid to ensure bubble free operation at the
tip. Figure~\ref{fig:tpc-UCLA-feedthrough} shows an example of the
feedthrough and filter box made by the UCLA group for the 35-t TPC,
as well as the conceptual design of a feedthrough suitable for the far
detector TPCs.
\begin{cdrfigure}[Concept of new feedthrough]{tpc-UCLA-feedthrough}

group for the 35-t TPC.  It was tested up to 150~kV.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{TPC Prototyping and Test}
\label{subsec:fd-ref-tpc-proto}


Several prototype TPC modules were constructed during the design phase
under the LBNE project. The initial prototypes were fractional scale
or partial models of the APA and CPA. The CPA prototype was used to
evaluate field-shaping electrode attachment techniques. A 40\% scale
APA prototype was constructed earlier on to study the placement of the
wire-wrapping boards and wire-support structures. It was also used to
develop the prototype winding machines. The prototypes were subjected
to numerous thermal cycles down to liquid-nitrogen temperature to test
the integrity of the wire-to-board and board-to-frame bonds.

The second set of prototypes are scale models of the APA and CPA. They
are being used to validate the designs and to evaluate production
procedures. These functional prototypes will be installed in the 35-t
prototype cryostat. This TPC is expected to be operational in 2015.

A TPC prototype that is proposed to go into a CERN test beamline
requires 6 full-size APAs with fully instrumented readout electronics,
6 full-size CPAs, and complete field-cage coverage. The TPC will be
constructed using identical APAs, CPAs and field-cage panels as
designed for the far detector. Additional features will be installed
to ensure proper TPC operation given the half-height cryostat
configuration. The construction and assembly of all TPC mechanical
components will use the same materials and techniques as designed for
the far detector, with the exception of a reduced degree of automation
than will be used to wire APAs.
