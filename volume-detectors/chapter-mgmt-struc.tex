\section{Overview}

The DUNE Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a means of organizing the work scope of the Project. 
The WBS decomposes the Project's tasks and deliverables into smaller, more manageable components. 
The overall DUNE Project (``Project xxx'') fixme{num?} within the Fermilab-wide WBS structure) is defined as Level 2 (L2). The constituent projects, in turn, get broken out into lower, component levels.
