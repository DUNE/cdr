\subsection{About this Volume}

The first part of \voldune{} of the CDR describes the strategies for
implementing the near and far detectors
(Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-strategy}) and outlines the DUNE management
structure (Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-pm}). The next part describes the
technical designs: the reference and alternative designs for the far
detector and the synergies between them
(Chapters~\ref{ch:detectors-fd-ref},~\ref{ch:detectors-fd-alt}
and~\ref{ch:detectors-synergy}), and the near detector systems design
(Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-nd-ref}).  Following this,
Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-sc} describes the designs for the computing
infrastructure and physics software, and
Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-proto} provides an overview of the ongoing
and planned prototyping effort.  The software and computing efforts,
as well as some of the prototyping activities are
off-project. Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-summary} summarizes and
concludes the volume.

\section{Introduction to the DUNE Detectors}
\label{sec:intro-dune-det}

\subsection{Far Detector}
\label{sec:intro-dune-far-det}

The proposed far detector (FD) will be located deep underground at the
SURF 4850L with a fiducial mass of 40~kt. It consists of four
cryostats instrumented with Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers
(LArTPCs).  It is assumed that all four detector modules will be
similar but not necessarily identical, allowing for evolution of the
LArTPC technology to be implemented.

LArTPC technology provides excellent tracking and calorimetry
performance. It is ideal for massive neutrino detectors that require
high signal efficiency, effective background discrimination,
capability to identify and precisely measure neutrino events over a
wide range of energies and high resolution reconstruction of kinematic
properties. The full imaging of events in the DUNE detector will allow
study of neutrino interactions and other rare events with
unprecedented detail. The detector's huge mass will result in data
sets large enough to enable precision studies and the search for CP
violation.

The mature LArTPC technology, pioneered by ICARUS, is the result of
several decades of worldwide R\&D.  Nonetheless, the size of a single
\ktadj{10} DUNE detector module represents an extrapolation by over
one order of magnitude relative to the ICARUS~T600, which is the
largest detector of this kind operated to date. To address this
challenge, DUNE is developing both a reference and an alternative
design (see Figure~\ref{fig:FarDet-overview-SPDP}), and is engaged in
a comprehensive prototyping effort.  A list of synergies between the
reference and alternative designs has been identified and is
summarized in Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-synergy}. Common solutions for
DAQ, electronics, HV feedthroughs, and so on, will be pursued and
implemented, independent of the details of the TPC design choice. The
development of the two detector module designs is a considerable
advantage, and it is made possible by the convergence of previously
separate international neutrino efforts into the DUNE Collaboration.

Interactions in liquid argon (LAr) produce ionization charge and
scintillation light.  The electrons drift in a constant electric field
away from the cathode plane towards the segmented anode plane.  The
prompt scintillation light is observed by photodetectors that provide
the absolute time of the event.  The reference design, described in
Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-fd-ref}, adopts a single-phase readout, in
which the readout anode is composed of wire planes in the LAr volume.
The alternate design, discussed in Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-fd-alt},
considers the dual-phase approach, where ionization charge is
extracted, amplified and detected in gaseous argon above the liquid
surface.  The dual-phase design allows a finer readout pitch (3~mm), a
lower detection-energy threshold, and better pattern reconstruction of
the events.  Both the reference and alternate designs include systems
to collect the scintillation light.


A comprehensive prototyping strategy for both designs is being
actively pursued, as described in Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-proto}.
The reference design, closer to the original ICARUS design, is
currently being validated in the 35-t prototype LAr detector at
Fermilab (see Section~\ref{sec:proto-35t}).  The novel alternative
design approach has been proven on several small-scale prototypes, and
a 20-t dual-phase prototype is being constructed at CERN, intended for
operation in 2016.  Full-scale engineering prototypes will be
assembled and commissioned at the CERN neutrino platform;

they are expected to provide the ultimate validation of the engineered
solutions for both far detector designs around the year 2018.

A test-beam data campaign will be executed at the CERN Neutrino Platform in the following years to
collect a large sample of charged particle interactions to study the
detector response with high precision.

The deployment of the four 10-kt modules at SURF will take several
years and be guided by principles detailed in
Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-strategy}. According to this strategy, DUNE
adopts the lowest-risk design that satisfies the physics and detector
requirements and allows installation of the first 10-kt detector
module as early as possible.  Accordingly, the first 10-kt module will
implement the reference design.  

A clear and transparent decision process will be adopted for
determining the design of the second and subsequent modules.  The
decision will be based on physics performance, technical and schedule
risks, costs and funding opportunities.  Besides taking advantage of
technological developments, a flexible approach to the far detector
design acknowledges the diversity of DUNE and offers the potential to
attract additional interest and resources into the Collaboration. A
staged approach provides access to an early science program while
allowing for new developments to be implemented over the relatively
long installation period of the experiment.

\subsection{Near Detector Systems}
\label{sec:intro-dune-near-det}

DUNE will install a near neutrino detector (NND) $\sim$0.5~km
downstream of the target and a Beamline Measurement System (BLM)
$\sim$300~m upstream of the NND. These are collectively called the
Near Detector Systems (NDS).  The NDS will allow DUNE to reduce
systematic errors to match the high-statistics phase precision sensitivity
for the long-baseline neutrino oscillation studies.  The primary role
of the neutrino detector is to measure the spectrum and flavor
composition of the beam to high precision. This detector will be
magnetized so that it can charge-discriminate electrons and muons
produced in the neutrino charged current interactions; it will
therefore be capable of making separate measurements of the neutrino
and antineutrino fluxes.

In addition, exposure to the intense neutrino flux provides the
opportunity to collect neutrino interaction data sets of unprecedented
size, enabling an extended science program.  The near detector
therefore provides an opportunity for a wealth of fundamental neutrino
interaction measurements, which are an important part of the ancillary
scientific goals of the DUNE collaboration.

The reference design for the neutrino near detector (NND) design is
the NOMAD-inspired fine-grained tracker (FGT) and is described in
Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-nd-ref}. The NND subsystems include a
central straw-tube tracker and an electromagnetic calorimeter embedded
in a 0.4-T dipole field. The magnet yoke steel will be instrumented
with muon identifiers.

The Beamline Measurement System (BLM), designed to measure the muon
flux from hadron decay, is located in the region of the beam absorber
at the downstream end of the decay region. It is intended to monitor
the beam profile on a spill-by-spill basis and will operate for the
life of the experiment.
