\subsection{About this Volume}

The first part of \voldune{} of the CDR describes the strategies for
implementing the near and far detectors
(Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-strategy}) and outlines the DUNE management
structure (Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-pm}). The next part describes the
technical designs: the reference and alternative designs for the far
detector and the synergies between them
(Chapters~\ref{ch:detectors-fd-ref},~\ref{ch:detectors-fd-alt}
and~\ref{ch:detectors-synergy}), and the near detector systems design
(Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-nd-ref}).  Following this,
Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-sc} describes the designs for the computing
infrastructure and physics software and
Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-proto} provides an overview of the ongoing
and planned prototyping effort.  The software and computing efforts,
as well as some of the prototyping activities are
off-project. Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-summary} summarizes and
concludes the volume.

\subsection{Far Detector}
\label{sec:intro-dune-far-det}

The proposed far detector (FD) will be located deep underground at the
SURF 4850L with a fiducial mass of 40~kt. It consists of four %identical 
cryostats instrumented with Liquid Argon Time Projection
Chambers (LArTPCs). 
It is assumed that all four detector modules will be similar but not
necessarily identical, allowing for evolution of the LArTPC
technology to be implemented.  % Anne moved this up from end of section

ideal for massive neutrino detectors that require high signal
efficiency and effective background discrimination, %excellent

allow study of neutrino interactions and other rare events with
unprecedented detail. The detector's huge mass will %enable

The mature LArTPC technology, pioneered by ICARUS, is the result of several decades of worldwide R\&D.
%The LArTPC concept, pioneered in the context of the ICARUS project, is

Nonetheless, the size of a single \ktadj{10} DUNE detector module represents an
extrapolation by %approximately 
over one order of magnitude relative to  %compared to the
the ICARUS~T600, which is the largest detector of this kind operated to date. To address this challenge,
DUNE is developing both a reference and an
alternative design (see Figure~\ref{fig:FarDet-overview-SPDP}), and is engaged in a comprehensive prototyping
effort. %At this stage, t
A list of synergies
between the reference and alternative designs has been identified and is
summarized in Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-synergy}. Common solutions for
DAQ, electronics, HV feedthroughs, and so on, will be pursued and
implemented, independent of the details of the TPC design choice. The development of the two detector module designs is %a strengthand an added value

Interactions in liquid argon (LAr) produce ionization charge and
scintillation light.  The %charge drifts 
electrons drift in a constant electric field
away from the cathode plane towards the segmented anode plane.  The
prompt scintillation light is observed by photodetectors that provide
the absolute time of the event.  The reference design, described in
Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-fd-ref}, adopts a single-phase readout,
in which the readout anode is composed of wire planes in the LAr
volume.  The alternate design, discussed in
Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-fd-alt}, considers the dual-phase approach,
where ionization charge is extracted, amplified and detected in
gaseous argon above the liquid surface.  The dual-phase design 
allows a finer readout pitch (3~mm), a lower detection-energy threshold,
and better pattern reconstruction of the events.  
Both the reference and alternate designs include systems to collect the
scintillation light.


A comprehensive prototyping strategy for both designs is being actively
pursued, as described in Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-proto}.  The
reference design, closer to the original ICARUS design, is currently
being validated in the 35-t prototype LAr detector at Fermilab (see Section~\ref{sec:proto-35t}).  The
novel alternative design approach has been proven on
several small-scale prototypes, and a 20-t dual-phase
prototype %(WA105 3$\times$1$\times$1) 
is being constructed at CERN, intended for
operation in 2016.  Full-scale engineering prototypes will be
assembled and commissioned at the CERN neutrino platform~\footnote{See CERN Bulletin article at \href{http://cds.cern.ch/journal/CERNBulletin/2014/51/News\%20Articles/1975980?ln=en}{http://cds.cern.ch/journal/CERNBulletin/2014/51/News\%20Articles/1975980?ln=en}.}; they are 
expected to provide the ultimate validation of the engineered solutions
for both far detector designs around the year 2018. 

A test-beam data
campaign will be executed in the following years to collect a large
sample of charged particle interactions to study the detector response
with high precision.  %These ongoing
%efforts including those at the CERN Neutrino Platform will provide the ideal
%environment to exploit these synergies and implement common solutions.  <--- Not needed (Anne)

The deployment of the four 10-kt modules at SURF will take several

Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-strategy}. According to this strategy, DUNE

A clear and transparent decision process will be adopted for
determining the design of the second and subsequent modules.  The
decision will be based on physics performance, technical and schedule
risks, costs, and funding opportunities.  Besides taking advantage of
technological developments, a flexible approach to the far detector
design acknowledges the diversity of DUNE and offers the potential to
attract additional interest and resources into the Collaboration. A
staged approach provides access to an early science program while
allowing for new developments to be implemented over the relatively
long installation period of the experiment.

\subsection{Near Detector Systems}
\label{sec:intro-dune-near-det}

DUNE will install a near neutrino detector (NND) $\sim$0.5~km
downstream of the target and a Beamline Measurement System (BLM)
$\sim$300~m upstream of the NND. These are collectively called the
Near Detector Systems (NDS).  The NDS will allow DUNE to reduce
systematic errors to match the high-statistics precision sensitivity
for the long-baseline neutrino oscillation studies.  The primary role
of the neutrino detector is to measure the spectrum and flavor
composition of the beam to high precision. This detector will be
magnetized so that it can charge-discriminate electrons and muons
produced in the neutrino charged current interactions; it will
therefore be capable of making separate measurements of the neutrino
and antineutrino fluxes.

In addition, exposure
to the intense neutrino flux provides the opportunity to collect
neutrino interaction data sets of unprecedented size, enabling an extended
science program.  The near detector therefore provides an
opportunity for a wealth of fundamental neutrino interaction
measurements, which are an important part of the ancillary %secondary 
scientific
goals of the DUNE collaboration.  

The reference design for the
neutrino near detector (NND) design is the NOMAD-inspired fine-grained
tracker (FGT) and is described in
Chapter~\ref{ch:detectors-nd-ref}. The NND subsystems include a
central straw-tube tracker and an electromagnetic calorimeter embedded
in a 0.4-T dipole field. The magnet yoke steel will be instrumented
with muon identifiers.

%The DUNE near neutrino detector %system

The Beamline
Measurement System (BLM), designed to measure the muon
flux from hadron decay, is located in the region of the beam absorber at
the downstream end of the decay region. It is intended to monitor the beam
profile on a spill-by-spill basis and will operate for the life of
the experiment.
