\chapter{Synergies Between FD Designs}
\label{ch:detectors-synergy}

\section{Overview}

The reference and the alternate design for the far detector are both liquid argon TPCs hosted in identical caverns, with identical cryogenic systems, and near identical cryostats (details of the cryostat roof are expected). They differ mostly in their differing approach to collect and readout the ionization signals. In the reference design, this charge is measured by successive induction on readout wire plans and eventually collected on a wire plane. In the alternate design, the charge is extracted from the liquid to the vapor, then amplified and finally collected on two perpendicular independent views. While the detailed detector configurations are based on different technical choices, this basic fact leads to a large number of potential synergies. 

In the following, we list a certain of number of synergies that are related to the following sectors or subsystems of the far detector:
 
\begin{itemize}

\item Interface with the cryogenic system

\item Drift high voltage 

\item Photon detection

\item Calibration

\item Underground installation strategies

\item Local computing infrastructure and DAQ

\item Detector modelling and simulations

\end{itemize}

In the following sections we will briefly discuss each of these items. 
  


\section{Interface with the cryogenic system}

Both designs are based on long drifts, of the order of several meters, of ionization electrons in liquid argon. These drifts require an excellent purity of the liquid argon, with electronegative impurities much below the ppb level and electron lifetimes at the ms scale. In both designs, the detector will be hosted in the same cryostat built using the industrial LNG cryostat technology. The contamination will come from impurities adsorbed on the tank and detector surfaces. It is therefore important to understand these sources and minimize their impact on the detector.

\section{Drift high Voltage}

One of the feature of a liquid argon TPC is the need for a large HV to produce an electric field of the order of 500 V/cm in the drift volume. 
In the two cases this requires then a HV generator, HV feed-though and a field cage to correctly shape the electric field. While far from being identical, this set of problems has a large number of commonalities for the two designs.

\end{itemize}


 
\section{Photon Detection}

The photon detection uses very different concepts. For the reference design it is based on light guide bars with TPB coating and SiPMs. 
For the alternate design it is based on large PMTs coated with TPB. Nevertheless several aspects related to these subsystems can be further developed through a collaborative effort.
Moreover, techniques developed in one design could be used in the other design. 

\begin{itemize}

\item Requirements refinement and validation	
  
\item Development and evaluation	  of	  photon	 detectors.	
  
\item Impact of  Background  light.	
    
\item  Surface reflectivity.	
  
\item Photon	 Detector  Calibration	

\end{itemize}




\section{Calibration}

The challenging requirement on systematic uncertainties calls for a full-fledged program of calibration, be it through calibration sources deployed in the detector, through complementary external measurements and through data-driven calibration procedures. We think this program allows for large synergies between the two designs. 

\begin{itemize}

\item Active

\item Energy

\item Energy

\item PID	
  likelihoods	
  
\item Absolute

\end{itemize}


\section{Underground installation strategies}
A fundamental aspect of the detector cost optimization is related to the development of an optimized strategy for underground logistics and detector installation. Dimensioning of the components to be transported and assembled underground is a common issue where synergies exist. Also at this level are the strategies for implementing the clean room. Additional tooling, such as scaffolding, are also a subject where common developments are expected to take place.

\section{Local computing infrastructure and DAQ}
Once the electrical signals from the detector have been conditioned (e.g. F/E preamplifiers), the treatment of the digitized raw-data and their compression can be strongly unified and will therefore provide synergies. The online computing farm will have a very similar layout for both reference and alternate designs. The software triggering and filtering algorithms will be based on similar local computing architectures, offering strong synergies. Finally, the local data storage and transmission to offsite tier-centers will be common.

\section{Detector Modelling and simulations}

An important aspect  of the far detector is a correct and detailed detector modelling to serve as the basis of the simulation of the signal (ionization electron and photons from argon scintillation) generated by neutrino interactions. The basis of these synergies is the fact that liquid argon serves as the TPC detection medium in both cases. Here the following synergies can be considered: 

\begin{itemize}

 \item Charge generation and transport 

\item Charge diffusion and attenuation	
  studies	
  
\item Noise and impact on the detector	performance	
  
\item Optical  model	 and light  propagation	
 
\end{itemize}

\section{Further steps
}

A large set of possible synergies between the different TPC alternate designs exists and will be further developed within the DUNE collaboration.  The program of demonstrators in the CERN neutrino platform will provide an excellent platform for joint detector development.
