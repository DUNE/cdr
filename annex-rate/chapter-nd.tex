\section{Data Rate Estimations}

This section summarizes the data rate estimations for the DUNE Near
Detector (ND).

Table~\ref{tab:nd-physical} give a summary of the event rates of
different ND detectors and from different sources.

    and rates.}

\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:nd-event-rates} give a summary of the event rates in
the ND system from different sources.

  \label{tab:nd-event-rates}
\end{table}

All ND components will have a sample size of \ndbytesperchannel and
given a nominal event size of \ndeventsize samples the expected
continuous data rate from the ND system as a whole is \nddatarate.
