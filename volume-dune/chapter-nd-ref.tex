\chapter{Near Detector Reference Design}
\label{ch:nd-ref}

The scope of the \fixme{} includes the design, procurement, fabrication, testing, delivery and installation of the mechanical and high voltage components of the \fixme{}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item  
\item 
\item 
\item 
\end{itemize}
This chapter describes the design for the near detector that meets the required performance for \fixme{}, developed for the DUNE experiment.
