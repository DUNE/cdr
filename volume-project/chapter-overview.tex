This introductory volume of the LBNF/DUNE Conceptual Design Report provides an overview of DUNE's science program (Chapter~\ref{v1ch:science}) and the technical designs of the facilities and the detectors 
(Chapter~\ref{v1ch:tech-designs}). It also describes the LBNF and DUNE organization and management structures 
(Chapter~\ref{v1ch:org-mgmt}) and the strategy (Chapter~\ref{v1ch:strategy})  that is being developed to construct, install and commission the conventional and experimental facilities in accordance with the requirements set out by the P5 report of 2014, which, in turn, is in line with the CERN
European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP) of 2013. \fixme{cite these documents}.
