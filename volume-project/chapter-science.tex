This chapter summarizes DUNE's potential for achieving its core
physics objectives based on the current %understanding of the
experimental landscape, scenarios for staging LBNF and DUNE, and the
technical capabilities of DUNE at each stage.  The objectives include
topics in long-baseline neutrino physics, nucleon decay, supernova
neutrinos, astrophysics and short-baseline physics.  A detailed
description of the physics objectives of DUNE is provided in Volume 2
of the CDR.

% The \ktadj{40} DUNE far detector (FD) is expected to be built as
% four \ktadj{10} modules,
For reasons described later in Chapter~\ref{v1ch:strategy}, the DUNE
far detector (FD) will be built as four \ktadj{10} modules, which will
come online over the course of several years. The staged program with
the FD rapidly growing in mass will enable an early start of the
science, initially primarily focused at the observation of natural
sources neutrinos, the searches for nucleon decays and the
measurements of backgrounds. Soon after the long-baseline neutrino
beam at FNAL will start operation sending neutrinos over the 1300~km
baseline.  The near detector (ND) will likely start operations after
beamline operation is already ongoing.  Without any ND constraints,
the neutrino flux will be moderately well constrainted in the early
stages of the experiment, however this will not significantly impact
the early physics programme since the statistical errors in the FD
will dominate in most channels.  It is assumed that data sets
collected during earlier stages will be reanalyzed with new
assumptions, so that each improvement in systematic uncertainty is
applied to the full exposure up to that point.  Eventually, the LBNF
beam power is expected to be upgraded from $\sim$\SI{1}\MW{} to
$\sim$\SI{2}\MW{} enabling high statistics to be collected in the
FD. Here, the ND will provide the necessary capability to reduce
systematic errors at the level where the full power of the beam
coupled to the large FD mass will yield the ultimate sensitivities of
the experiment.

\section{Long-Baseline neutrino oscillation physics}
%\subsection{Long-Baseline/Oscillation Physics}

The DUNE science reach is described in details in \volphys as a
function of exposure.  The exposure is a measure of the amount of data
collected and is expressed in units of \ktMWyr{}. For instance, an
exposure of \SI{300}\ktMWyr{} corresponds to seven years of data
(\num{3.5} years in neutrino mode plus \num{3.5} years in antineutrino
mode) with a \ktadj{10} detector and a \SI{1.07}\MW{} beam.

For the estimate of the sensitivity of DUNE as a function of real time
for the first \num{10} years of operation, a staging plan is assumed 
to determine the reachable
exposure as a function of the running years. For the discussions below,
the following staging plan has
been assumed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Year 1: \SI{10}\kt{} FD mass; \SI{1.07}\MW{} beam power; No ND
  constraints (assume \num{5}\% signal systematic)
\item Year 2: Add second \ktadj{10} FD module, for a total FD mass of
  \SI{20}\kt
\item Year 3: Add third \ktadj{10} FD module, for a total FD mass of
  \SI{30}\kt; Include constraints from preliminary ND data analysis
  (assume \num{3}\% signal systematic)
\item Year 4: Add fourth \ktadj{10} FD module, for a total FD mass of
  \SI{40}\kt
\item Year 5: Include constraints from a full ND data analysis (assume
  \num{2}\% signal systematic)
 \item Year 7: Upgrade of beam power to \SI{2.14}\MW
\end{itemize}
It is assumed that previous data sets can be reanalyzed with new
assumptions, so each improvement in systematic uncertainty is applied
to the full exposure up to that point.

%Add that integrated exposure is 535 kt-MW-yr after 10 years?

The \SIadj{1300}{\km} baseline, coupled with the wide-band
high-intensity neutrino beam from LBNF, establishes one of DUNE's key
strengths: sensitivity to the matter effect. This effect leads to a
discrete asymmetry in the \numu $\to$ \nue versus \anumu $\to$ \anue
%$\nu_\mu\to \nu_e$ versus $\overline{\nu}_\mu \to \overline{\nu}_e$
oscillation probabilities, the sign of which depends on the presently
unknown mass hierarchy (MH).  At 1300~km this asymmetry is
approximately $\pm 40\%$ in the region of the peak flux; this is
larger than the maximal possible CP-violating asymmetry associated
with \deltacp, meaning that both the MH and \deltacp can be determined
unambiguously with high confidence within the same experiment.

In detail, the sensitivity of DUNE depends on the actual values of
poorly known mixing parameters (mainly \deltacp and
\sinst{23}), %$\sin^2{\theta_{23}}$),
as well as the true value of the MH itself.  

%The discrimination
%between the two MH hypotheses is characterized as a function of the
%\emph{a priori} unknown true value of \deltacp by considering the
%difference, denoted $\Delta \chi^2$, between the $-2\log{\cal L}$
%values calculated for a data set with respect to these hypotheses,
%considering all possible values of \deltacp
The discriminating power between the two MH hypothesis is quantified
by considering the difference, denoted $\Delta \chi^2$, between the
$-2\log{\cal L}$ values calculated for the normal and inverted
hierarchy. As the sensitivity depends on the true value of the unknown
CP violating phase, \deltacp, all possible values of \deltacp are
considered.  \footnote{For the case of the MH determination, the usual
  association of this test statistic with a $\chi^2$ distribution for
  one degree of freedom is incorrect; additionally the assumption of a
  Gaussian probability density % added 'a'
  implicit in this notation is not exact.  The discussion in Chapter~3
  of \volphys provides a brief description of the statistical
  considerations.}.  In terms of this test statistic, the MH
sensitivity of DUNE with an exposure of \SI{300}\ktMWyr{} is
illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:mhexec} for the case of normal
hierarchy and the current best fit value of \sinst{23} =
\SI{45}. %$\sin^2 \theta_{23} = 0.45$.
%

\label{fig:mhexec}
\end{cdrfigure}

Across the overwhelming majority of the parameter space for the mixing
parameters that are not well known (mainly \deltacp and \sinst{23}),
DUNE's determination of the MH will be definitive, but even for
unfavorable combinations of the parameter values, a statistically
ambiguous outcome is highly unlikely.  The least favorable scenario
corresponds to a true value of \deltacp in which the MH asymmetry is
maximally offset by the leptonic CP asymmetry.  
%and where,
%independently, \sinst{23} takes on a value at the low end of its
%experimentally allowed range.  
For this %worst-case
scenario, studies indicate that with an exposure of \SI{400}\ktMWyr{}  (which corresponds to \num{8.5} years with the staging plan outlined
earlier), the DUNE LArTPC, operating in the \GeVadj{80} 
%\MWadj{1.07} actually power changes in staging plan
(reference design) beam, can --- in a typical data set --- distinguish
between normal and inverted hierarchy with $|\Delta \chi^2| =
\overline{|\Delta \chi^2|} = 25$.  This corresponds to a $\geq
99.9996\%$ probability of determining the correct hierarchy.  In
$>97.5\%$ of data sets, DUNE will measure $|\Delta \chi^2| > 9$ in
this scenario, where measuring $|\Delta\chi^2| = 9$ with an expected
value of \num{25} corresponds to a significance in excess of three
Gaussian standard deviations. Improvements to the beam design can
lower the exposure needed to reach this level of sensitivity from
\SI{400}\ktMWyr{} to around \SI{230}\ktMWyr{} (\num{6.5} years of
running in the example staging plan). The dependence of the mass
hierarchy sensitivity on systematics is still under evaluation, but
current studies indicate a weak dependence on systematic
uncertainties. This indicates that a measurement of the unknown
neutrino mass hierarchy with very high precision can be carried out
during the first few years of operation with an optimized beamline
design.

Concurrent analysis of the corresponding atmospheric-neutrino samples
in an underground detector will improve the precision and speed with
which the MH is resolved.

%It is important to note that for the
%initial stages of DUNE, a greatly improved level of precision in the
%determination of the MH can be achieved by incorporating
%constraints from NO$\nu$A and T2K data.  
%With an initial 10~kt detector, for half
%the range of possible \deltacp values, the expected significance 
%exceeds $\overline{\Delta \chi^2} = 25$; again this corresponds to a $\geq
%99.9996\%$ probability of determining the correct hierarchy.  To put
%this in context, it is notable that even an extended NO$\nu$A
%program~\cite{Messier:2013sfa} at four times its nominal exposure (of six
%years of operation at \SI{700}{\kW}), would have coverage at the
%$\overline{\Delta \chi^2} = 9$ level or better for only $40\%$ of the
%\deltacp range.

With regard to the search for CP-violation using the \numu to \nue and
\anumu to \anue oscillation channels, the DUNE program has two
somewhat distinct objectives.  First, DUNE aims to observe a signal
for leptonic CP violation independent of the underlying nature of
neutrino oscillation phenomenology. Such a signal will be observable
in comparisons of $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}
\rightarrow \bar{\nu}_e$ oscillations of the LBNF beam neutrinos over
the \SIadj{1300}{\km} baseline. In the three-flavor mixing model
described by the PMNS matrix, CP violating effects occur for values
of \deltacp not equal zero or $\pi$. Second, DUNE aims to make a precise
determination of the value of \deltacp within the context of the
standard three-flavor mixing scenario described by the PMNS neutrino
mixing matrix. Together, the pursuit of these two goals provides a
thorough test of the standard three-flavor scenario.

Figure~\ref{fig:execsummaryCP} shows the expected sensitivity to CP
violation as well as the 1$\sigma$ resolution for \deltacp as a
function of exposure.  The exposure in detector mass (kiloton)
$\times$ beam power (MW) $\times$ time (years) required to measure
$\delta_{\rm CP} = 0 $ with a precision better than $10^\circ$ ranges
from 290 to \SI{450}\ktMWyr{} depending on the beam design.
%At this beam power, in a six-year run,
%a \ktadj{10} far detector will be able to measure \deltacp to $\pm$
%20$^\circ$ $-$ 30$^\circ$ (depending on its value), independent of
%other experiments.
%This would be equivalent to a six-year run with a \SI{1.2}{\MW} beam.
A fully realized 
DUNE operating with multi-megawatt 
beam power can eventually achieve a precision 
comparable to the current precision on the CP phase in the
CKM matrix in the quark sector (5\%).

 \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{volume-physics/figures/dcp_exp_staging.pdf}
\end{cdrfigure}
%
To reach $5\sigma$ sensitivity for 50\% of the range of \deltacp, a
DUNE exposure in the range of \num{550} to \SI{810}\ktMWyr{}  is needed. The
range of exposures corresponds to potential variations in the beam
design, with the highest exposures corresponding to the reference beam
design. Table~\ref{tab:execosctable} summarizes the exposures needed to
achieve specific oscillation physics milestones.  The sensitivities
and exposures calculated are for the current best fit values of the
known neutrino mixing parameters. Changes in the value of
$\theta_{23}$ impact CP violation and mass hierarchy sensitivities the
most, as discussed in Volume 2, and can reduce or increase the exposure
needed to reach discovery potential for CP violation over a
significant fraction of \deltacp values. In addition, potential
improvements in beamline geometry, focusing and target element designs
that can significantly lower the exposure required for CP violation
discovery potential as demonstrated in Table~\ref{tab:execosctable}. Several such potential improvements are discussed
in CDR Volume 2 and Volume 3. A highly capable near neutrino detector
is required to control systematic uncertainties at a level lower than
the statistical uncertainties in the far detector needed to reach this
level of sensitivity.  No experiment can provide coverage at 100\% of
\deltacp values, since CP violation effects vanish as $\mdeltacp\to 0$
or $\pi$.
  
In long-baseline experiments with \numu beams, the
magnitude of \numu disappearance and \nue appearance signals is
proportional to \sinstt{23} and \sinst{23},
%$\sin^2{2\theta_{23}}$ and $\sin^2{\theta_{23}}$,
respectively, in the standard three-flavor mixing scenario.  Current
\numu disappearance data are consistent with close to maximal
mixing, $\theta_{23} = 45^\circ$.  To obtain the best sensitivity to
both the magnitude of its deviation from $45^\circ$ as well the 
$\theta_{23}$ octant, a combined analysis of the two channels
is needed~\cite{Huber:2010dx}.  As demonstrated in Volume 2, a
\ktadj{40} DUNE detector with sufficient exposure will be able to
resolve the $\theta_{23}$ octant at the $3\sigma$ level or better for
$\theta_{23}$ values less than $43^\circ$ or greater than $48^\circ$.
A fully realized DUNE can measure $\theta_{23}$ with a precision of
$1^\circ$ or less, even for values within a few degrees of
$45^\circ$. 

To summarize, DUNE long-baseline program will comple
our understanding of the oscillation phenomenology. 
DUNE has great prospects to discover CP-violation or in absence of
effect, set stringent limits on the allowed values of the $\delta_{\rm CP}$
phase. DUNE will also determine the neutrino mass hierarchy with better
than a $5\sigma$~C.L.

\section{Nucleon Decay Physics Motivated by Grand Unified Theories}


The DUNE far detector will significantly extend lifetime sensitivity
for specific nucleon decay modes by virtue of its high detection
efficiency relative to water Cherenkov detectors and its low
background rates.  As an example, DUNE has enhanced capability for
detecting the $p\to K^+\bar{\nu}$ channel, where lifetime
predictions from supersymmetric models extend beyond, but remain close
to, the current (preliminary) Super-Kamiokande limit of $\tau/B >
\SI{5.9e33}{year}$ (90\% CL) from a \SI[number-unit-product = -,
inter-unit-product=\ensuremath{{}\cdot{}}]{260}{\kt\year}
exposure~\cite{kearns_isoups}\footnote{The lifetime shown here is
  divided by the branching fraction for this decay mode, $\tau/B$, and
  as such is a \emph{partial lifetime}.}.  The signature for an
isolated semi-monochromatic charged kaon in a LArTPC is distinctive,
with multiple levels of redundancy. 

The DUNE LArTPC far detectors deep underground will reach a limit of
\SI{3e34}{\year} after 10-12 years of operation
(Figure~\ref{fig:execsummarypdk}) depending on the deployment
scenario, and would see nine events with a background of 0.3 should
$\tau/B$ be \SI{1e34}{\year}, just beyond the current limit. A
\ktadj{40} detector will improve the current limits by an order of
magnitude after running for two decades. Even a \ktadj{10} detector
would yield an intriguing signal of a few events after a ten-year
exposure.


\begin{cdrfigure}[Sensitivity to the decay $p\to K^+ \bar{\nu}$

    decay $p\to K^+ \bar{\nu}$ as a function of time for different DUNE

  For comparison, the current limit from SK is also shown, as well as the projected limit from the proposed Hyper-K experiment with \SI{5600}\ktyr{} of exposure.
  The limits are at 90\% C.L., calculated for
  a Poisson process including background, assuming that the detected events
  equal the expected background.}

\end{cdrfigure}

Supersymmetric GUT models in which
the $p\to K^+\overline{\nu}$ channel mode is dominant also favor
other modes involving kaons in the final state, thus enabling a rich 
program of searches for nucleon decay in the DUNE LArTPC detectors.

%\paragraph*{Studies of Supernova Neutrino Bursts.}
\section{Supernova-Neutrino Physics and Astrophysics}

The neutrinos from a core-collapse supernova are emitted in a burst of
a few tens of seconds duration, with about half in the first
second. Energies are in the range of a few tens of MeV, and the
luminosity is divided roughly equally between the three known neutrino
flavors.  Currently, experiments worldwide are sensitive primarily to
electron antineutrinos ($\bar{\nu}_e$), with detection through the inverse-beta decay
process on free protons\footnote{This refers to neutrino interactions with the nucleus of a
hydrogen atom in H$_2$O in water detectors or in hydrocarbon chains in 
liquid scintillator detectors.},
 which dominates the interaction rate in water
and liquid-scintillator detectors.  Liquid argon has a unique sensitivity to
the electron-neutrino ($\nu_e$) component of the flux, via the absorption
interaction on $^{40}$Ar as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\nu_e +{}^{40}{\rm Ar} & \rightarrow & e^-+{}^{40}{\rm K^*}
\end{eqnarray*} 
This interaction can be tagged via the coincidence of the emitted
electron and the accompanying photon cascade from the $^{40}{\rm K^*}$
de-excitation.  About \num{3000} events would be expected in a \ktadj{40}
fiducial mass liquid argon detector for a supernova at a distance of
\SI{10}{\kilo\parsec}.  In the neutrino channel the oscillation
features are in general more pronounced, since the $\nu_e$ spectrum is
always significantly different from the $\nu_\mu$ ($\nu_\tau$) spectra
in the initial core-collapse stages, to a larger degree than is the
case for the corresponding $\bar{\nu}_e$ spectrum.  Detection of a large
neutrino signal in DUNE would help provide critical information on key
astrophysical phenomena such as
\begin{itemize}
\item the neutronization burst
\item formation of a black hole
\item shock wave effects
\item shock instability oscillations
\item turbulence effects
\end{itemize}

In addition to providing unprecedented information on the mechanics of
the supernova explosion, observation of a core-collapse supernova in
DUNE will also enable searches for numerous types of new physics
including various Goldstone bosons (e.g., Majorons), neutrino magnetic
moments, new gauge bosons (``dark photons''), ``unparticles'' and
extra-dimensional gauge bosons.

\section{Precision Measurements with the DUNE Near Detector}
%%\section{Precision Measurements with a High-Intensity Neutrino Source and High-Resolution Near Detector}

The DUNE near neutrino detector (ND) will provide precision measurements of
neutrino interactions, which are essential
for controlling the systematic uncertainties in the long-baseline
oscillation physics program.  The near detector %, which will include argon targets, 
will include argon targets and will measure the absolute flux and energy-dependent
shape of all four neutrino species, \numu, \anumu, \nue and \anue,
%$\nu_\mu$, $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$,$\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$, 
to accurately predict for each species the
far/near flux ratio as a function of energy.  It will also measure the
four-momenta of secondary hadrons, such as charged and neutral mesons,
produced in the neutral and charged current interactions that
constitute the dominant backgrounds to the oscillation signals.

The near detector will also be the source of data for a rich program of neutrino-interaction 
physics in its own right. For an integrated beam intensity of 
\num{1e20} %$1 \times 10^{20}$
protons-on-target at \SI{120}{GeV}, the expected number
of events per ton is 
 \num{288000} (\num{96000}) %$\nu_\mu$ ($\overline{\nu}_\mu$) 
\numu (\anumu) charged current 
and \num{98000} (\num{43000})  neutral current interactions in the $\nu$ ($\overline\nu$) beam. These numbers correspond to
\num{e7}  neutrino interactions per year for the range of beam
configurations and near detector designs under consideration.
Measurement of fluxes, cross sections and particle production over a
large energy range of \SIrange{0.5}{50}{\GeV} are the key
elements of this program.  These events
will also help constrain backgrounds to proton decay signals from atmospheric neutrinos.
Furthermore, very large
samples of events will be amenable to precision reconstruction and
analysis, and will be exploited for sensitive studies of electroweak
physics and nucleon structure, as well as for searches for new physics
in unexplored regions, such as heavy sterile neutrinos, high-$\Delta m^2$
oscillations, light Dark Matter particles, and so on. 

%Furthermore, since the near detector data will feature very large samples of events that are amenable to precision reconstruction and analysis, theycan be exploited for sensitive studies of electroweak physics andnucleon structure.

\section{Summary}
%\section{Concluding Remarks}


This chapter %has touched 
touches only briefly on the most prominent portion of
the full suite of physics opportunities enabled by DUNE.  
%\fixme{Makes
%  it sound like there are MANY physics topics not mentioned here.} 
\volphys includes a more detailed discussion and covers topics %, as well as topics
that were omitted here in the interest of brevity and focus.  In
Chapter~\ref{v1ch:strategy} progress toward DUNE physics milestones is
addressed, based on potential scenarios for the deployment of DUNE
detector modules, the beamline and PIP-II implementations. 
%The present chapter concludes with a summary of its key points.

In summary, the primary science goals of DUNE are drivers for the
advancement of particle physics. The questions being addressed are of
wide-ranging consequence: the origin of flavor and the generation
structure of the fermions (i.e., the existence of three families of
quark and lepton flavors), the physical mechanism that provides the CP
violation needed to generate the Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe
(BAU), and the high-energy physics that would lead to the instability
of matter.  Achieving these goals requires a dedicated, ambitious and
long-term program.  No other proposed long-baseline neutrino
oscillation program with the scientific scope and sensitivity of DUNE
is as advanced in terms of engineering development and project
planning.  Implementation of a staged program with a far detector of
even modest size in the initial stage (e.g., \SI{10}\kt) will enable
exciting physics in the intermediate term, including a definitive mass
hierarchy determination and a measurement of the CP phase without
ambiguities, while providing the fastest route toward achieving the
full range of DUNE's science objectives.  Should DUNE find that the CP
phase is not zero or $\pi$, it will have found strong indications
($>3\sigma$) of leptonic CP violation.

The DUNE experiment is a world-leading international physics
experiment, bringing together the %world's
global neutrino community as well as leading experts in nucleon decay
and particle astrophysics to explore key questions at the forefront of
particle physics and astrophysics. The highly capable beam and
detectors will enable a large suite of new physics measurements with
potential groundbreaking discoveries.
