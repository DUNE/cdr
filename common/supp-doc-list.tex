%\chapter{Supporting Documents}
% AH 12/30/11: Since I'm pulling this in as a chapter in vol 1 and as a subsection in section 1.1 of vols 2-6, I'm taking the chapter heading out and putting it directly into the file that inputs all the content of volume 1
A host of information related to the CDR is available in a set of supporting documents. Detailed information on risk analysis and mitigation, value engineering, ES\&H, costing, project management and other topics not directly in the design scope can be found in these documents, listed in 
Table~\ref{table:cd-1-doc-list}. Each document is numbered and stored in LBNE's document database, accessible via a username/password combination provided by the Project. Project documents stored in this database are made available to internal and external review committees through Web sites developed to support individual reviews.
