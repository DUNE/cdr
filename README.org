#+TITLE: DUNE Conceptual Design Report

* Author Guidance

For guidance on writing and editing and git gymnastics see the
[[https://github.com/DUNE/document-guidance][guidance document]].  When
following that guidance, replace the use of the label =guidance= with
the name of the volume or annex in this repository.  For example =volume-physics=.

* Releases

Fixed releases, with built PDFs are available from the [[https://github.com/DUNE/lbn-cdr/releases][release area]] as
zip or tar.gz archives.

PDFs are generated from the most recent commits and they are available [[https://dune.bnl.gov/tmp/][here]]


* Building the documents

You need a =pdflatex= from a relatively recent LaTeX distribution.  Details are in [[./build.org]].
