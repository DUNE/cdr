\chapter{Cold Electronics}
\label{ch:ce}

\begin{editornote}
  Editor's Note:  This is a new chapter, created from the ``In-Vessel Front-End Electronics'' section formerly in the TPC chapter.
Therefore some values reported here will be incorrect for the design as of January 2015. 
While the old section has been removed from the TPC chapter, some additional ``cleanup'' is still needed there,
to finish removal of CE material that still may be present in the TPC chapter but perhaps no longer belongs there.
Also, this material has not been updated for the increased number of APAs or APA size change.
\end{editornote}

The scope of the Cold Electronics (CE) subsystem includes the design, procurement, fabrication, testing,
delivery and installation of the in-vessel electronics chain involved in the readout of the TPC:

\item All electronics on the CMBs
\item Signal feedthroughs (which includes low-voltage power and control lines)
\item Low-voltage and TPC bias-voltage power supplies
\item Signal and power cabling between the CMBs and feedthroughs
\item Signal and power cabling between the feedthroughs and external power supplies and interface crates
\end{itemize}
This chapter describes the reference design for the CE that meets the required performance for the LBNE liquid argon detector,
LAr-FD.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:ce-intro}

The front-end electronics will operate at cryogenic temperatures. The system must provide 
amplification, shaping, zero supression, digitization, buffering and multiplexing of the signals.  All functions of the readout chain will be programmable via a register on the ASICs. The APAs will need to be
self-triggering since, unlike neutrino-oscillation measurements for which the pulsed beam 
can provide a trigger for readout, most other measurements, such as proton decay
and supernova bursts, will have no trigger.  

The readout electronics are optimized for operation in the cryogenic environment.  
The front-end ASIC chip utilizes a mixed-signal design.  
It has 16 channels of preamp, a shaper and an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) in its analog section,  
followed by a large, shared buffer and the digital IO interface.
Each ADC has two parallel readout lines, each of which multiplexes eight channels, yielding a factor of 8:1.
Eight such chips 
are mounted on a single readout board, instrumenting 128 adjacent wires in one plane. 
A digital-processing ASIC with an 8:1 multiplexer on this board further 
increases the multiplexing factor to 64:1 with two parallel output channels.
Data from each output channel will be transmitted through two redundant LVDS (low-voltage differential signaling)
output cables to a signal feedthrough and from there to an external crate mounted near the feedthrough.

One cable bundle is planned for each APA to connect to the outside of the cryostat.
The bundle will consist of wires for low-voltage power, wire-bias voltages, data out, clock in,
digital control IO and an analog monitoring output.
Redundant cables will be provided for many of these functions.
The 52 cable bundles will be connected through 26 feedthroughs distributed on the roof of the cryostat.
Additional feedthroughs will be required for redundant high-voltage connections to the CPAs.

\section{Design Considerations} 
\label{sec:ce-reqs-n-specs}

The requirements for the CE can be found in the requirements documentation \cite{lar-fd-req}.
The most significant ones are the following:

\begin{itemize}	
\item Provide the means to detect charged particles in the detector and transmit the detector signals to the
Data Acquisition System (DAQ)
\item Provide redundancy in the discrimination of electrons from photon conversions and ensure long-term reliability
over the life of the experiment
\item Optimize the measurement of high-energy and low-energy tracks from accelerator-neutrino interactions
\item Enable the detector to distinguish a Minimum Ionizing Particle (MIP) from noise with a signal-to-noise ratio $>$ 9:1
\item Enable the detector to measure the ionization up to 15 times that of a MIP particle;
this is necessary to perform particle identification of stopping kaons from proton decay
\item Operate for the life of the facility without signifcant loss of function
\item Record the wire-signal waveforms continuously without dead time
\item Use only materials that are compatible with high-purity liquid argon

\end{itemize}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Architecture}
\label{subsec:fe-arch}

The large number of readout channels (276,480) required to instrument
each cryostat of the LAr-FD TPC dictates the use of CMOS ASICS for the electronics. 
Requirements of low noise (less than 1000 rms electrons for a wire
capacitance of 220 pF) and for achieving extreme purity of the LAr dictate that
the front-end electronics be located at the signal wires in the LAr.  This
reduces the signal capacitance and hence the noise. Significant levels of 
signal multiplexing can then also be used, minimizing the number of cables
in the ullage gas and the attendant 
outgassing of electronegative impurities.
This electronics
architecture, combined with the modular TPC elements, also leads to a
TPC implementation that can be readily scaled to any detector size or
geometry.

Figure~\ref{fig:ce-elec-schematic} shows the architecture of a front-end electronics
design that meets the requirements for the LAr-FD TPC. The entire
electronics chain is immersed in the LAr and operates at
89~K. It is composed of a 16-channel front end implemented as a
mixed-signal ASIC providing amplification, shaping, digitization,
buffering, a 16:1 multiplexing stage, a driver and voltage regulators.
Eight front-end ASICs plus a single digital ASIC implementing an
8:1 multiplexer, clock and control circuitry comprise a 
single 128-channel front-end readout board.  A third digital ASIC containing a
multiplexing stage (20:1) and driver is used for each APA module to serialize all of the data
from the 20 readout boards on a single APA (for a total of 2,560 channels per APA) and
transmit it out of the cryostat on either a twisted copper pair or an
optical fiber. The choice between twisted-pair copper and optical fiber will be
postponed until further work is completed to evaluate the long-term reliability
of optical drivers at LAr temperature. The data rates per APA
are not expected to be high enough to require the use of optical fibers.
For either choice, a two-fold redundancy per APA will be implemented
to minimize the probability of the loss of an entire APA.


Figure~\ref{fig:ce-elec-asic-layout} shows a block diagram of the proposed 16-channel front-end
ASIC. Each channel includes a charge amplifier with a selectable of
gain 4.7, 7.8, 14 and 25~mV/fC (full scale charge of 55, 100, 180 and
300~fC), a high-order anti-aliasing filter with adjustable time
constant (peaking time 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 $\mathrm{\mu}$s), an option to enable an AC
coupling, baseline adjustment for operation with either the collecting
or the non-collecting wires, a 12-bit 2 MS/s ADC and a zero-suppression/data
compression stage. Shared among the 16 channels are the bias circuits,
programming registers, a temperature monitor, the digital multiplexer (16:1), an
analog buffer for signal monitoring, and the digital interface. A 600-kb 
buffer will be included in this design, capable of storing a 1.5-ms 
event sampled at 2~MS/s in each channel assuming no compression. Two or
more events can be stored with compression. The layout size is on the
order of 10 $\times$ 5~mm${^2}$, which would provide a
yield in excess of 90\%. The estimated power dissipation is below 15~mW
per channel at 1.8~V supply.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Data Rates}

For neutrino-oscillation measurements the pulsed beam can provide a
trigger for readout, but for most other measurements, such as proton decay
and supernova bursts, there will be no trigger.  Therefore the APAs will be
self triggering.  

Data rates will then
be dependent on the event rates for background processes.  Dominant
backgrounds are decays of radionuclides in the LAr,
predominantly the naturally occurring Ar$^{39}$.  The cosmic-muon rate at the 4850 Level is approximately 2.3~mHz per APA.  Reading an APA (2,560 wires) for
one drift time (4,625 samples) gives 142~Mb of data. At the cosmic-event rate,
the net data rate is 0.3~Mb/s per APA.  For radioactive decay of Ar$^{39}$
the rates are much higher: the specific activity is 1~Bq/kg which results in 183~kHz/APA.
At this rate, the APA will be continuously read out, at a prohibitive data
rate of 61~Gb/s; of course, since the ionization produced by these events is highly localized,
most of the drift ``frame'' is empty.

The mean range of the beta from Ar$^{39}$ decay is only 0.3~mm, so all
of the signal is contained in a single over threshold sample of a single wire, for a true ``information''
rate of 0.6~Mb/s. In order to
reduce the rate (and volume) of recorded data to tolerable values, 
zero suppression and data buffering must be
provided.  The simplest scheme is to do this at the APA level, deriving
a write-enable from the logic OR of discriminators on all the charge
collecting (Y) wires in an APA, and then writing all data to a buffer
while the write-enable is true.  Baseline samples could be recorded
with reduced range (4 bits) and compacted into full words.  This mode
would still record large volumes of data without useful
information, particularly for simple event topologies and from low-energy 
events (radioactive decays) and noise. 

A more effective
zero-suppression can be implemented at the chip level with a dedicated buffer for each
channel having a write-enable consisting of the OR of  that channel and
its two nearest neighbors.  A few samples before and after the write-enable 
will also be recorded to capture the below-threshold leading
and trailing edges of the signal waveform.  This mode provides maximal
zero-suppression that is insensitive to localized low-energy events
and noise. This scheme would reduce the data rate per APA for Ar$^{39}$ decays to
18~Mb/s. The rate for Kr$^{85}$ decays would be about four times lower.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption[Conceptual architecture of zero-suppression]{Conceptual architecture of zero-suppression using a write enable using separate analog shaping}
\label{fig:ce-elec-write-enable}
\end{figure}


A conceptual diagram of this zero-suppression implementation is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:ce-elec-write-enable}. The write-enable for each channel is derived from a separate
shaping amplifier with AC coupling to remove low-frequency, baseline
fluctuations. Multiple programmable discriminators in the
``write-enable'' logic are
needed to sense both unipolar (collection wire) and bipolar (induction
wire) waveforms.  The write-enable gate passes to, and is OR-ed with,
channels of adjacent wires to record the below-threshold portion of
charge shared with these wires. As individual channel buffers fill, they
are transferred to a large output buffer shared with all 16
channels for transmission off the chip.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{CMOS Circuit Design}

To successfully design CMOS circuits that will operate at cryogenic 
temperatures, two critical issues must be addressed and resolved. 
The first is the requirement for realistic models at the operating temperature 
of active devices, interconnects and passive components (resistors and 
capacitors) in order to reliably predict operating points, signal response 
and noise during the design process. The second critical requirement is 
that the design must ensure a long operational lifetime, since once the TPC is filled 
with LAr the detector must operate for about 15~years without any access to the 
electronics for repair or replacement. Concerning the availability of realistic models, 
our preliminary results from the cryogenic characterization (down to 40 K) of a complete 
mixed-signal ASIC \cite{CMOS-Compton} in a commercial CMOS 0.25~$\mu$m technology, 
originally developed for room-temperature applications, indicates that the models 
are useful to first order. To refine these models, several 
single-transistor test structures were fabricated on the first prototype of the 0.18~$\mu$m device. 
Measurements of the properties of these structures at cryogenic temperatures 
have been used to refine the device models at 89~K. 

The lifetime of CMOS circuits is limited by several mechanisms which degrade 
the performance over time, eventually causing the circuit to fail to perform as specified. 
The rates of most degradation mechanisms in CMOS, such as electro-migration (EM), 
stress migration (SM), time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB), thermal cycling (TC), 
and negative bias-temperature instability (NBTI), all scale with temperature such that 
cryogenic operation is favored \cite{CMOS-lifetime}\cite{PMOS-model}. The only mechanism 
that could affect the lifetime at cryogenic temperature is the degradation due to 
impact ionization, which causes charge trapping in the MOSFET gate oxide at 
large drain-current densities (the ``Hot Carrier'' effect). Results from a CMOS reliability study~\cite{CMOS-reliability} 
provide general design guidelines (for device geometry, bias and current density) 
that should guarantee a lifetime well in excess of 15~years for continuous cryogenic operation. 
These design guidelines also provide information for designing test conditions to observe the 
deterioration mechanism and to extrapolate from accelerated deterioration rates, 
measured under stressed conditions within practical times, to the ultimate lifetime under normal operation.

A monitor of the impact ionization is the bulk current, which reaches a maximum at $V_DS = V_DD$ and at $V_GS = 0.5 V_DD$. 
When operating constantly in this condition at room temperature, a properly designed device 
will typically have a lifetime (defined as a 10\% degradation in $g_m$) of about 10~years. 
The bulk current (i.e., the impact ionization) increases by roughly a factor of four from 300~K to 77~K 
\cite{CMOS-reliability} and a circuit designed for operation at room temperature would have 
a proportionately shorter useful life at cryogenic temperature. As stated above, in order to guarantee 
the required lifetime at cryogenic temperatures, design guidelines must be modified for both analog 
and digital circuits. For analog circuits, this is done by operating the devices at moderate-to-low 
drain current densities, where impact ionization becomes negligible. For digital circuits, 
operating the devices with reduced $V_DD$ (about 20\%) and using non-minimum channel length L, 
which is easily accommodated since at cryogenic temperature the speed of the digital circuit increases, 
compensating for the increased L. These guidelines will be verified with accelerated aging tests, 
at increasing values of $V_DD$, on dedicated structures. Such tests also will be conducted on 
prototype samples throughout the development process to verify the long-term reliability of the final ASICs.

The development of the readout ASIC has begun by designing and fabricating in a commercial CMOS
process (0.18~$\mu$m and 1.8V) a 16-channel
ASIC implementing the complete analog front-end section of the scheme shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ce-elec-asic-layout}. 
This process is expected to be available for at least another 10~years. 
The charge
amplifier input MOSFET is a p-channel biased at 2~mA with a L/W (channel length/width) ratio
of 0.27~$\mu$m / 10~mm, followed by dual
cascade stages. The charge amplification and shaping filter have
digitally programmable gain and peaking time as described above. Each
channel also implements a high-performance output driver which, in the
final version, will be replaced with a sample-and-hold stage preceding
the ADC. The ASIC integrates a band-gap reference (BGR)  to
generate all the internal bias voltages and currents. This guarantees a
high stability of the operating point over a wide range of
temperatures, including cryogenic. The ASIC is packaged in a
commercial, fully encapsulated plastic QFP 80 package.

This ASIC has now been through three design/fabrication/testing revision cycles. Prototypes from each cycle have been evaluated and characterized at room (300~K) and liquid nitrogen
(77~K) temperatures. During these tests the circuits have been cycled multiple times
between the two temperatures and operated without any change in
performance. Figure~\ref{fig:ce-elec-shaper-out} shows the measured pulse response, along with
details on the adjustability of the gain, peaking time and baseline.
These results are in close agreement with the simulations and indicate
that both the analog and the digital circuits and interface operate as
expected in a cryogenic environment. Simulations and experimental results
show that the pole-zero cancellation needs to be optimized, which will
be done in the next revision of the design. Also reported in Figure~\ref{fig:ce-elec-shaper-out}  are
the outputs of the BGR and temperature sensor, which are in close
agreement with the simulations as well.

\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=4in]{v5c3-cel-enc.pdf}
\caption[Measured ENC vs filter time constant]{Measured ENC vs filter time constant from the first two versions of the analog front end ASICs}
\label{fig:ce-elec-enc}
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:ce-elec-enc} shows the measured ENC versus filter-time constant (peaking time).
At 1~$\mu$s about 650 e$^{-}$ was measured,
to be compared to the simulated value of 500 e$^{-}$. The difference is
mainly due to the thermal noise from a $\sim$
11-ohm parasitic resistance of the input
line (shown in the detail of Figure~\ref{fig:ce-elec-enc}), which contributes about 350
electrons at 77~K. The width of the line will be increased in a
revision in order to make this contribution negligible. A second
contribution, on the order of 100 e$^{-}$, was due to the dielectric
loss from the  capacitor (220~pF) used to simulate the wire (the cases of MICA and NPO ceramic were compared). This contribution would not be
present with the input connected to a sense wire in the TPC.

Each channel is equipped with an injection capacitor which can be used
for test and calibration and can be enabled or disabled through a
dedicated register. The injection capacitance has been measured using 
a calibrated external capacitor. The measurements show
that the calibration capacitance is extremely stable, changing from
184~fF at room temperature to 183~fF at 77~K. This result and the measured
stability of the peaking time demonstrate the high stability of the
passive components with the temperature. Channel-to-channel and chip-to-chip
variation in the calibration capacitor are typically less than 1\%. Measurements are being carried
out on the individual test structures fabricated on this ASIC to
confirm device models and design guidelines.

All data, control, bias and power supply lines will be duplicated to
provide redundancy to avoid the loss on an entire APA.  Four APAs will be
cabled to warm feedthroughs in ``chimneys'' in the roof of the cryostat that
contain the support rods for the TPC planes.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{CE Infrastructure}
\label{sec:ce-feedthru}
   
The CE infrastructure includes low-voltage supplies, all power cables and cable routing to the supplies,
signal cables and cable routing to the DAQ, and the low-voltage (signal) cryogenic feedthroughs.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Design Considerations} 
\label{subsec:ce-feedthru-reqs-n-specs}

\begin{itemize}
\item All power supplies must be able to be monitored and 
controlled both locally and remotely through the DAQ system.  
They must have over-current and over-voltage protection circuits.
\item The power supplies for the wire-plane bias voltages
must provide sufficient current.   The output-voltage ripple 
must not introduce more than 10\% of the equivalent thermal noise from the front-end electronics. 
\item The low-voltage (signal) feedthroughs must be able to withstand twice their nominal operating voltages 
with a maximum specified leakage current in 1-atm argon gas, and must be able to deliver sufficient DC current.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Reference Design} 
\label{subsec:ce-feedthru-desc}

There are two types of low-voltage power supplies:
TPC wire-bias voltages and low-voltage DC power to the readout electronics.
A single type of feedthrough will handle the signals, supply volgages, and control lines.
All cables inside the cryostat will be copper.
Optical fiber will be employed only external to the cryostat, and does not fall under the purview of the CE subsystem.

All cables inside the cryostat will be attached to their corresponding feedthroughs distributed throughout the cryostat roof.
The other ends of the cables will be connected to the matching connectors on the APAs in the cryostat.
The cables for the lower APAs must be carefully threaded through the hollow frames of the APA stacks.
The cables will be strain-relieved on the  mounting rails above the APAs. 

Measurements in the Materials Test Stand at Fermilab (described in Section~\ref{sec:mts})
have shown that impurities (principally O$_2$ and H$_2$O) embedded in objects submerged in the liquid argon do not result
in a decrease in electron-drift lifetime, whereas impurities in objects located in the warmer gas phase do.
This indicates the importance of minimizing the amount of material in the gas ullage at the top of the cryostat.
Therefore it may be desirable to connect all cables to feedthroughs below the liquid surface,
and then pass the cables out of the cryostat, through an evacuated volume that traverses the gas and cryostat insulation,
to a matching set of feedthroughs to the outside. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption[Conceptual design of signal/power feedthrough]{A conceptual design of a signal/power feedthrough using all off-the-shelf commercial components}
\label{fig:tpc-signal-feedthrough}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Wire-Bias Voltages}
\label{subsec:ce-feedthru-wirebias}

Each anode plane assembly requires three bias voltage connections 
at $+$820V, $-$370V, and $-$665V.  The current on each of these 
supplies is expected to be zero at normal operation.  However the ripple 
voltage on the supply must be carefully controlled 
to avoid noise injection into the front-end electronics.  

The power supplies for the wire bias will be similar to 
those used for conventional multi-wire proportional chambers. 
Additional filtering networks will 
be needed to further reduce voltage ripples.  
The default feedthroughs are the commercial SHV type.  
However,  other, higher-density multi-channel 
feedthroughs capable of withstanding the maximum voltage are under investigation.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Power for the Cold Electronics }
\label{subsec:ce-feedthru-power}

The power-per-channel for the front-end ASIC is designed to be about 15~mW and
the total power requirement for each APA is expected to be about 65~W.
Power will be supplied to the electronics on each APA separately by low-noise
power supplies outside the cryostat, either directly by
low-voltage (1.8~V), high-current (36 A) conductors or by high-voltage (48~V)
low-current (2~A) conductors to DC-DC converters placed locally in the LAr.
The use of DC-DC converters requires conductors with smaller cross section,
minimizing heat input to the cryostat (and ice formation of the feedthroughs).
However, the power dissipated by the (somewhat inefficient) converters in
the LAr will create boiling which may introduce contamination directly into the 
high-purity LAr, and if enough LAr is vaporized, may also produce strong mixing of the
ullage gas, driving more impurities into the liquid.
These effects of boiling LAr, unless they can be demonstrated to be harmless,
will drive a preference for eliminating DC-DC converters, and directly powering the front-end readout boards.

Heat conduction through the high-current feedthroughs and the self-heating ($I\cdot R$) of the wires are the factors
contributing to additional heat load on the cryogenic system.
The sum of the these two factors as a function of the wire gauge, however, has a minimum 
due to the two opposing dependencies on the copper-wire cross section.
An optimum wire gauge can be chosen to minimize heat input to the cryostat.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Digital Data IO Feedthoughs}
\label{subsec:ce-feedthru-digital}

The TPC data rate per APA, using the zero-suppression and full event-buffer scheme described earlier, appears sufficiently low that it is within the capability of a single LVDS channel on copper. Optical fiber will be used if data must be transmitted at a much higher rate.  In this case, the number of optical fibers will be two per APA for redundancy, or 102 for each five-kton module. Commercial optical-fiber feedthroughs are available to meet this demand.

In addition to the high-speed data-output channels,  LVDS connections will be made to each APA to 
distribute a clock signal and control information.  These data 
can be transmitted at a lower bit rate, clearly within the
capabilities of LVDS. The number of channels for these signals 
are on the order of thousands in the entire detector, easily covered by commercial multichannel feedthroughs. 

A conceptual design of an APA signal/power feedthrough flange is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tpc-signal-feedthrough}.  Based on a standard 8-in conflat flange with all commercial off-the-shelf components, each of these feedthroughs will serve the bias/power/digital IO needs of four APAs.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{CE Prototyping, Test and  Checkout}
\label{sec:ce-checkout}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{CE Prototyping}
\label{sec:ce-checkout-prototype}

Several prototype TPC modules will be constructed during the 
design phase.  The initial prototypes will be fraction scale or 
partial models of the APA and CPA.  The CPA prototype will be used 
to evaluate the wire-mesh tension and field-shaping electrode 
attachment techniques.   The APA prototype will be used to study 
the placement of the wire-wrapping boards and wire-support structures.  
It will also be used to develop the prototype winding machines.  
The prototypes will undergo numerous thermal cycles down to 
liquid-nitrogen temperature to test the integrity of the wire-to-board
and board-to-frame bonds.

The second set of prototypes will be scale models of the 
APA and CPA.  They will be used to validate the designs and 
to evaluate production procedures.  Prototype front-end electronics 
boards are expected to be available at this stage.  This TPC will be assembled in the 35-t prototype cryostat, expected to be operational in 2015.

A prototype that is proposed to go into the CERN neutrino beamline requires three full-size APAs with fully instrumented readout electronics, six full-size CPAs, and complete field-cage coverage.  The TPC will be constructed using identical APAs, CPAs and field-cage panels as designed for the LAr-FD.  Additional features will be installed to ensure proper TPC operation given the half-height cryostat configuration. The construction and assembly of all TPC mechanical components will use the same materials and techniques as designed for LAr-FD, with the exception of a reduced degree of automation that will be used to wire APAs for the LAr-FD.

A complete set of cold electronics will be installed on the APAs.  The electronics components will closely resemble those designed for the LAr-FD. All key features of the LAr-FD electronics chain, including preamp, shaper, ADC, digital buffer, zero suppression and multiplexing will be implemented.  Some  electronics  may be in prototype or functional-equivalent form.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Assembly Testing}
\label{sec:ce-checkout-test}

The front-end readout boards will be thoroughly tested.
\begin{itemize}
\item A small number of the ASICs will undergo a complete suite 
of tests, including thermal cycling to determine the batch yield.
\item If the yield is high ($>$ 95\%), all ASICs will be mounted 
on the front-end boards.  Tests will be performed on each board  
and bad chips replaced as needed.
\item If the yield is not high, an automated test fixture will be 
fabricated to validate every ASIC chip before mounting on the 
readout boards.  Board-level tests after mounting the
ASICs will be conducted.
\item The fully assembled front-end boards will be thermally cycled multiple times while connected to a simple DAQ system to ensure reliable operation.
\item The wire-carrier boards will be thermally cycled and HV stressed.
\end{itemize}

The APAs will also undergo testing.
\begin{itemize}
\item The tension and electrical continuity of each wire will be 
measured after the plane of wires is bonded to the frame.
\item After the front-end electronics boards have been installed on 
the APA, an initial calibration of all electronic channels will be 
performed.  The electronic gains and noise levels of all channels will be 
recorded in a database.
\item A cool-down stress test will be performed on each completed 
APA in a liquid-nitrogen environment.  Electronic calibration on 
all channels will be performed while the APA is cold and again
after it is warmed up.  Significant differences in the cold and warm calibration 
results will be investigated and remediated.  
\end{itemize}

For the CPAs, a cool-down stress test will be performed on each completed 
CPA in a LN2 environment.  After warming up, 
 the tension of the wire mesh will be checked.


For the field cages,  the resistance will be measured along each copper strip,  
and between strip pairs.  The resistance between two 
strips should exceed 1 G$\Omega$, without the resistive divider. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Checkout } 
\label{sec:ce-checkout-checkout}

After passing the tests at the assembly level, the APAs will be 
put into storage, and later transported to the LBNE Far Site.  
Prior to installation, another round of electronic calibration will be 
performed on the APAs to validate their acceptable status.  

During installation, the DAQ system will be running continuously.  As soon 
as each stack of APAs is connected to the pre-routed cables, 
a suite of calibration runs will be performed to validate that all connections have
been made properly.  Repair or replacement at this stage will 
still be straightforward.

After the entire TPC is assembled, a system-wide calibration 
will be performed at room temperature and again at cryogenic 
temperature in argon gas.  Repair or replacement would
require partial disassembly of the TPC and should be avoided 
unless absolutely necessary.  

The responsibility and authority for the design, installation 
and use of the detector quiet-power distribution and 
detector-grounding system is held by the  
subproject electrical engineer. 
This engineer 
has oversight responsibility for all electrical and electronics 
design and installation tasks, including all attachments to the detector 
that create an electrical connection.
