\chapter{The Near Neutrino Detector: A Fine-Grained Tracker}
\label{ch:nd-nnd}

\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec:nd-nnd-intro}

The DUNE Fine-Grained Tracker (FGT) near detector consists of a straw-tube
tracking detector (STT) and electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) inside of a 0.4 T
dipole magnet. In addition, Muon Identifiers (MuIDs) are located in the
steel of the magnet, as well as upstream and downstream of the STT. The FGT
is designed to make precision measurements of the neutrino fluxes, 
cross sections, signal rates and background rates. 
This document presents 
the FGT design, which 
will meet the physics goals and sensitivities of the DUNE experiment. 

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:nd-nnd-motivation}

In order for DUNE to achieve the desired neutrino-oscillation sensitivity, the 
charged-current signal events and neutral-current
background events in the DUNE far detector (FD) must be precisely 
predicted as a function of the parameters and variables that affect 
oscillations. These include energy, leading lepton (which tags the neutrino flavor) and the 
momentum and identification of particles generated by neutrino interactions. 
At the FD, the first and the second 
oscillation maxima signals occur at about 2.4 GeV and 0.8 GeV, respectively 
--- an energy regime where neutrino cross sections and fluxes have large 
uncertainties. It is therefore crucial to measure the unoscillated neutrino fluxes and 
their interactions at the near site. 

In addition to the oscillation signal, it is 
critical to identify and measure processes such as neutral current $\pi^0$ production,
that can mimic oscillation signals 
at the FD. Thus, the principal focus of the neutrino detector will be 
on the neutrino-oscillation energy range of $E_\nu < 8$ GeV, as well as higher 
neutrino energies that produce background to the oscillation signal. Furthermore, the
$8<E_\nu < 20$ GeV energy range can be used as a ``control region'' %or
i.e., a region in which 
to search for physics beyond the PMNS matrix. Clearly, 
the measurements must be 
comparable to those made in the FD, for which the target material is liquid argon (LAr). 

Finally, the neutrino detector must measure nuclear effects, including
short-range correlations, two-body currents, pion absorption, initial-state interactions, 
and final-state interactions. These nuclear effects 
have an impact on neutrino cross sections and energy determinations, and differences
between neutrinos and antineutrinos must be fully understood when searching
for CP violation.

The proposed detector will constrain the systematic uncertainties in the DUNE 
oscillation measurements. Regardless of the process under study, the 
systematic error should be less than the corresponding statistical error. 
The design presented here is the subject of study within the DUNE Science 
Collaboration. As these studies 
progress, the design of the DUNE near neutrino detector, 
referred to as the Fine Grained Tracker (FGT) in this document, may 
evolve from what is described here. 

\section{Overview of FGT Design}
\label{sec:nd-nnd-fgt}

A schematic drawing of the 
FGT design is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:STT_schematic}. 
The fine-grained tracker %design 
will measure the neutrino event rates and cross sections 
on argon, water, and other nuclear 
targets for both $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$ charged current (CC) and
neutral current (NC) scattering events. The FGT design 
consists of a straw-tube tracker (STT), consisting of straw tubes, water targets, argon targets, 
and radiator targets, and an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), both inside a
dipole magnet. In addition, muon detectors (MuID) consisting of resistive plate
chambers (RPCs) will be embedded in the steel
of the magnet. 

The FGT has excellent position and angular resolutions due to
its low-density ($\sim0.1$ g/cm$^2$) and high-precision STT. This high 
resolution is important for determining the neutrino
vertex and determining whether the neutrino interaction occurs in the water
or argon target.  The
proposed $3.5\times3.5\times6.4$ m$^3$ STT's position inside the 
dipole magnet with magnetic field $B = 0.4$~T will enable particle tracking. %\fixme{check edits}
The nominal active volume of the STT corresponds to 8~tonnes (metric tons, t) of mass, 
which is mostly due to the STT targets and radiators. 
Table~\ref{tab:comparison} summarizes the
performance for the FGT configuration, and
Table~\ref{tab:STT_specs} lists the specifications for the FGT. %\fixme{What's listed there is not a set of requirements; they're specs that we hope follow from requirements!}

Given a 120-GeV proton beam, %\fixme{that leads to a neutrino flux of ...?; WCL: rate is expressed as events per tonne per proton. Ok AH}, 
the neutrino event rates in the detector
will be $\sim0.35\times 10^{-14}$ events/tonne/proton on target.
Assuming $0.5\times 10^{14}$ protons per beam spill, this corresponds
to $\sim1.5$ events per spill in the 8-t active volume of the FGT
design.  Overlaps between interactions are expected to be
manageable thanks to the nanosecond-level timing of the FGT relative to
the $\sim10$-$\mu$s beam-spill length.

\section{Straw-Tube Tracking Detector}
\label{sec:nd-nnd-straw}

\subsection{Straw Tubes}

The Straw-Tube Tracking Detector (STT) %is located 
at the center of the FGT %and 
will be composed of straw tubes with an outer diameter of 1~cm, as well as 
radiators and targets that reside next to the straw tubes (see Figure~\ref{fig:STT_Detail}).
Vertical (YY) and horizontal (XX) planes of straws will be alternated and 
arranged in modules, with each module containing close-packed double straw layers 
of vertical and horizontal straws (XXYY). 
Figure~\ref{fig:STT_Detail} shows a schematic drawing of an STT module with four straw-tube planes and
radiators. 
An alternative design has also been considered; it calls for two planes of straws
per module, XX, YY, and so on. It will have approximately the same number of
total straw tubes in the tracker but twice as many modules. \fixme{Is there a schematic of it?; WCL: not at present}
%; however, the number of modules will be doubled.
%In what follows, 
The performance and the cost of the STT are expected to be similar 
in both the reference (4-Planes/Module) and alternative (2-Planes/Module) designs.
 The straw tubes will be filled with a
gas mixture of either 70\% Ar plus 30\% CO$_2$ (for modules with targets) or
70\% Xe plus 30\% CO$_2$ (for modules with radiators). 
%A carbon composite sheet ($< 250 \mu$m thick), 
%as shown in Figure~\ref{STT_film}, 
%will provide support for each plane of straws. 
The dimensions of each module in the reference design will
be approximately 350~cm $\times$ 350~cm $\times$ 8.0~cm, including 
target or radiator planes and four straw planes. For ease of construction and
transportation, each module is made up of six sub-modules, with dimensions of
appproximately 350~cm $\times$ 117~cm $\times$ 2.0~cm. 
The straw tubes in a single sub-module will be able to provide the tension 
for the wires, however, a temporary sub-module carbon composite frame will 
be employed for shipping. The sub-modules will be assembled %put together 
into modules 
at Fermilab, where each module will have a new carbon composite frame around 
the perimeter of the module for support and will have an attached target or 
radiator. Nominally, there will be 34 modules with targets and 46 modules 
with radiators, still keeping the 
average density of the STT at around 0.1 g/cm$^3$.

radiators (dark blue shading)}
\includegraphics[width=4in,angle=90]{STT_Detail}
\end{cdrfigure}

%There are 
The STT will have a total of 107,520 straws  --- corresponding to 336 straws per plane,
1344 straws per module ---
and 80 modules. Both ends of the straw tubes will be read out, leading to a total
number of electronics channels of 215,040. 
The total mass of the STT, including targets and radiators, is approximately 8 
tonnes, corresponding to an average density of 0.1. %\fixme{prev sentence already said}
The thickness of the entire 6.4-m-long STT is almost two 
radiation lengths. Specifications for the Straw Tube Detector are shown in Table~\ref{tab:STT_details}.

\end{cdrtable}

\subsection{Radiator Targets}

Radiators will be placed in the downstream STT modules
and will serve as targets for both neutrino interactions 
and Transition Radiation (TR) production. Each STT module contains 
four radiators, where each radiator consists of
60 layers of 25-$\mu$m polypropylene (C$_3$H$_6$)$_n$ 
foils alternating with 60 sheets of 125-$\mu$m tulle fabric spacers. 
The mass of each radiator is $\sim27$ kg and the thickness is 
$\sim9$ mm. 
Thin graphite planes and/or carbon fiber foils can be added to some STT modules
in order to have a total carbon target mass of about 0.5~t. (This is in addition to
the carbon in the STT frames.) A statistical subtraction of events occurring
on the pure carbon target from the ones in the polypropylene radiators will provide a measurement of
antineutrino interactions on a free proton target, which can be used for flux determination and cross
section measurements.

\subsection{Argon, Water, and Other Nuclear Targets}

Both argon
and water will be implemented as target materials for neutrino interactions.
The argon targets will measure neutrino interactions on the same material as the far detector, while
H$_2$O and D$_2$O water targets can be used to determine, through subtraction, the
neutrino fluxes off of ``free'' neutron targets. Antineutrino fluxes off of ``free''
proton targets can be obtained, through subtraction, from C and CH$_2$ targets.
The targets will be 
positioned directly upstream of individual modules without radiators. 
The targets, shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:STT_targets}, will consist of planes of 0.5-inch diameter, 3.5-m-long aluminum tubes filled
either with water (H$_2$O or D$_2$O) or with argon gas pressurized to 140 atm ($\rho = 0.233$). 
%There will be a total of 44 modules 
%with argon targets and 20 modules with water targets. 
We will place 273 tubes in each 
plane, spaced 0.505-in apart. The tube wall thickness will depend on the fill material.
%; 0.065-in for the 
%pressurized Ar and 0.028-in for water. The water mass per plane is 95 kg 
%(106 kg for D$_2$O), 
%corresponding to a total water mass
%(H$_2$O and D$_2$O) of 1.9 tonnes. 
%while the argon mass per plane is 15.4 kg.
%, corresponding to a total argon mass of 0.68 tonnes.
Additional nuclear targets, such as Ca (same atomic weight as argon), C, stainless
steel, and Pb, can also be used in
the form of thin planes, to be positioned directly upstream of individual STT modules without radiators.

\section{Electromagnetic Calorimeter}
\label{sec:nd-nnd-emcalo}

An electromagnetic calorimeter 
(ECAL) will surround the tracking volume on all sides and consist of three separate pieces: Forward ECAL, Barrel ECAL, and Backward ECAL.  
The ECAL conceptual design 
%is based on the design of the T2K ECAL and 
consists of 
layers of either 1.75-mm-thick (for the forward ECAL) or 3.5-mm-thick 
(for the barrel and backward ECAL) lead sheets and 2.5-cm-wide by 10-mm-thick 
plastic scintillator bars,
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ECAL_detail}. The scintillator layers for the
Forward and Backward ECAL alternate as XYXYXY..., while the scintillator 
layers for the Barrel ECAL are all horizontal along the axis of the magnet.
The Forward ECAL will consist of 60 layers of scintillator bars, where each
bar has dimensions 3.2~m $\times$ 2.5~cm $\times$ 1~cm. The
Backward ECAL will consist of 16 layers of scintillator bars, where each 
bar has the same dimensions, 3.2~m $\times$ 2.5~cm $\times$ 1~cm. The Barrel ECAL will also consist 
of 16 layers of scintillator bars, where each bar has the same dimensions, 
3.2~m $\times$ 2.5~cm $\times$ 1~cm. 

The lead sheets and scintillator bars will be assembled and glued together
into complete modules of dimension 
3.2~m $\times$ 3.2~cm $\times$ 81~cm for the Forward ECAL and
3.2~m $\times$ 3.2~cm $\times$ 27.5~cm for the Backward ECAL. For the Barrel ECAL, the module 
dimensions will also be 
3.2~m $\times$ 3.2~cm $\times$ 27.5~cm. Two Barrel modules are placed end-to-end 
along the sides of the inner surface of the magnet (eight Barrel modules
total) to provide full coverage of the barrel region.
The total numbers of scintillator bars in the
Forward, Backward, and Barrel ECAL are 7,680, 2,048, and 16,384, respectively, 
for a total of 26,112 bars. 

The scintillator bars will be extruded with 
holes in the middle of each bar. The
holes will then be fitted with 0.7-mm-diameter Kuraray wavelength-shifting (WLS) fibers.
The fibers will be read out by SiPM (silicon photomultiplier) photosensors at each end, making the number of 
readout channels twice the number of scintillator bars 
for a total of 52,224. The total mass of scintillator is 20.9~t, 
the total mass of Pb is 70.8~t, and
the total length of fiber is 83.6~km.
Specifications for the ECAL are shown in Table~\ref{tab:ECAL_specs}.  
Figure~\ref{fig:ECAL_gaps} shows a side view of the ECAL (red) inside the dipole
magnet, where there is very little gap between the Barrel ECAL and the Forward ECAL.

\section{Dipole Magnet} 
\label{sec:nd-nnd-dipole}

The STT and ECAL modules will reside inside a 0.4-T dipole 
magnet for the measurement of particle momentum and charge. 
The magnet will have inner dimensions (inside the coils) 
4.5-m wide $\times$ 4.5-m high $\times$ 8.0-m long. The 
magnet 
%is modeled after the CERN 
%UA1 magnet with 
has four vertical Al coils, stacked horizontally, producing a horizontal magnetic 
field. The return yoke will be divided into two halves along the 
longitudinal center line to allow the magnet to be opened to service the
detector inside, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:STT_schematic}. 
Each half yoke will be built
from eight ``C'' (C-shaped) sections, and the thickness of the 
magnet steel will be 60~cm, consisting of 6
$\times$ 10-cm-thick plates. The magnet power requirement with Al coils is $\sim 2.4$~MW,
corresponding to 6~kA at 400~V. The water flow required for cooling is 20~l/s.
The Dipole Magnet specifications are shown in Table~\ref{tab:Magnet_specs}.

The momentum resolution is dominated by multiple scattering in the STT. The momentum resolution is, therefore, given by 
$\delta p/p = 0.053/\sqrt(LX_0)B$. For B = 0.4T, L = 3m, and $X_0 = 4$m, the
expected momentum resolution is $\sim 3.8\%$.

\section{Muon Identifier}
\label{sec:nd-nnd-muid}

%\fixme{Lots of repetition here; can we just say 'like the LArTPCT MuID except for these differences...?}
%I would rather have the repetition so that it is a stand-alone section. BL}
The sides and ends of the dipole magnet will be instrumented
with a muon identifier
detector (MuID) that will distinguish muons from hadrons by the ability 
of muons to penetrate the iron without showering or interacting.
The MuID will consist of 432 RPC modules
interspersed between two 10-cm-thick steel plates of the 
dipole magnet and between 20-cm-thick steel plates at the upstream and
downstream ends of the magnet. 
The MuID is only meant to provide %the 
identification of the 
muon; the muon momentum %itself 
will be measured by the STT inside the 
magnetic field. A schematic drawing of the MuID 
interspersed in the magnet steel is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:FGT_MuID}.

The nominal dimensions of all RPC modules will be 1~m $\times$ 2~m with
active areas of 96~cm $\times$ 196~cm. Each
module has 256 X strips
at 7.65-mm pitch and 128 Y strips at 7.5-mm pitch. The modules
will be grouped into trays each containing six modules, and the trays will
be sufficiently wide to allow overlapping modules. 
The end RPC trays have dimensions of 2~m $\times$ 6~m, and there are three trays per plane.
The downstream end has five planes, corresponding to 15 trays and 90 RPC modules.
The upstream end has three planes, corresponding to nine trays and 54 RPC modules.
The vertical barrel-RPC trays have dimensions of 2.5~m $\times$ 4~m, 2.8~m $\times$ 4~m, and
3.1~m $\times$ 4~m for the inner, middle, and, outer planes, respectively, corresponding
to 24 trays and 144 RPC modules. The horizontal
barrel-RPC trays have dimensions of 2.2~m $\times$ 4~m, 2.5~m $\times$ 4~m, and
2.8~m $\times$ 4~m for the inner, middle and outer planes, respectively, 
corresponding to 24 trays and 144 RPC modules. Overall, there is a total of
72 trays, 432 RPC modules, and 165,888 strips and electronic channels. 

The downstream MuID will contain five steel planes of 
overall dimensions
6 $\times$ 6 $\times$ 0.2~m$^3$ (283.5~t)
and five RPC planes, while the upstream MuID will contain three steel
planes (170.1~t) of dimensions 6 $\times$ 6 $\times$ 0.2~m$^3$ and three RPC planes. The barrel MuID will contain
24 planes (three layers $\times$ eight sides) of RPCs. The RPCs will have a total thickness 
of 15~mm and a gap width of 2~mm. One possible gas mixture could be %composed, for example,
of Ar (75\%), tetraflouroethane (20\%), isobutane (4\%),
and sulphurhexaflouride (1\%). 
A schematic drawing of an RPC is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:FGT_RPC}, while
Figure~\ref{fig:RPC_Tray} shows a schematic drawing of an end RPC tray,
and Figure~\ref{fig:FGT_RPC} shows a schematic drawing of an RPC module.

\section{FGT Instrumentation}
\label{sec:nd-nnd-intrumentation}

The instrumentation includes both fast readout electronics for the subdetectors
and the slow control ($\mathcal{O}$ seconds) of the subdetectors, involving monitoring the humidity, 
temperature, gas pressure, etc.
There is considerable synergy in the information gathered in the STT, ECAL and MuID. 
Both the STT and ECAL are required to measure the total charge and the time associated with a 
given hit. The MuID RPCs are required to provide the position and time associated with 
a traversing track. Similarly, the slow control of the subdetectors
share many features.
A brief description of the subdetector instrumentation is presented here, while
Table~\ref{tab:elect_ch} summarizes the number of electronics channels for each of the
subdetectors. 

%\fixme{Add something here about the cooling-water flow and voltage and current monitoring; you have no information in the subsections, so they should be removed.}

\subsection{Readout Electronics} % for the FGT}

The electronics for the three subsystems, STT, MuID, and ECAL, are all ``fast'' systems, 
i.e., all of the signals are %fast 
in the few-to-10 nanosecond range.  The STT output has 
a roughly 10-nanosecond rise time with a total integrated charge of about of about 100 
electrons per centimeter.  The gain of the STT drift tubes are typically $10^4$ to $10^6$, 
so over a collection time interval of $\sim100$~ns
the integrated charge is  $10^6$ to $10^8$ electrons. 
The MuId system contains Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) that can operate 
in either streamer mode or avalanche mode; the difference 
being that streamer mode is not proportional to 
the deposited charge, whereas the avalanche mode 
is.  The rise time of the RPC signal is a few nanoseconds and charge is 
collected immediately; the collected charge can be large, up to 100 pC.  The ECAL 
signals come from a SiPM that converts the light from the 
scintillator strips to an electronic signal. The deposited charge in the scintillator 
will give rise to $10^3$ to $10^5$ photoelectrons.  The gain of a SiPM is $\sim10^6$ and 
has a rise time of a few nanoseconds, so the total charge can be $>100$ pC. As these 
three systems all have gain and are fast, it is hoped that a 
common electronics system may be possible. 

The requirements for each system are very similar: a fast output and both an ADC % on each channel, 
and a TDC on each channel.  %An additional requirement 
Additionally, for the STT straw tubes it 
is desirable to wave-form digitize the analog signal in order to enhance the ability to separate 
the ionization signal from the transition radiation signal.  
The total channel count is 433,152 channels; this is broken out into 215,000 for the  STT, 165,000 for the
 MuID, and 52,224 for the ECAL. Most available electronic systems from 
existing experiments don't quite meet these requirements or are too expensive to implement 
for this channel count (\$50/channel has been allocated).  Recently, %we have been made aware of 
an interesting new ASIC development for an upgrade to the ATLAS muon system at the LHC %.  The development 
has come out of BNL. \fixme{add G. DeGeronimo at BNL ref} 
 A schematic of the newly developed chip (VMM2) is shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:VMM2}.  It handles 64 channels and produces both fast ADC and TDC outputs.
It has been fabricated and tested and should be ready by 2017, long before it will be needed for DUNE. %our needs.  
The VMM2 features are the following:

\item front-end electronics (ASIC)
\item more than 2.3 million channels total
\item operation with both charge polarities
\item sensing element capacitance of 10-200 pF
\item charge measurement up to 2 pC at $< 1$ fC RMS
\item time measurement $\sim100$~ns at $< 1$ ~ns RMS

\subsection{NND Data Acquisition} % Nearsite Neutrino Detector (NND) DAQ}
\label{sec:nd:nnd:daq}

%\fixme{why isn't this called the FGT-DAQ?  It's hard to know whether to use FGT or NND. FGT is easier to keep straight in your mind from NDS, that's for sure!; WCL: we agreed with Hans to use NND-DAQ. Ok AH}

As the Near Neutrino Detector (NND) is part of DUNE's Near Detector System (NDS), the Near Neutrino Detector Data Acquisition system (NND-DAQ) collects raw data from 
each %near 
NND subsystem and connects to the (overall) Near 
Detector System DAQ (NDS-DAQ) via Gigabit Ethernet. This is described in 
Chapter~\ref{ch:nd-gdaq}. A block diagram of the NND-DAQ is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DAQ_NND}.
Similar to the NDS-DAQ, the NND-DAQ will mainly consist 
of a scalable back-end computer array, inter-connected to the individual NND 
subdetector DAQs via Gigabit Ethernet and specialized electronics modules for trigger 
processing and clock synchronization. It interfaces to the NDS Master DAQ (NDS-MDAQ),
described in Section~\ref{sec:nd-master-daq}, for 
run control and NDS  data collection. The NND-DAQ will also have its own local run-control setup, 
consisting of a number of desktop workstations to allow independent local runs that include 
NND subdetectors only, which is useful during detector commissioning, calibration runs, 
stand-alone cosmic runs or other runs where the beam is stopped or not needed.

The quantity of computers required for the back-end system is highly dependent on the 
number of channels and expected data rates of the individual neutrino detectors. Based on 
T2K Near Detector DAQ experience\fixme{ref? (not addressed)}, one back-end computer should be able to handle 
approximately 3,000 channels for sustainable and continuous runs. Assuming a total of 
430,000 channels for all NND subdetectors combined, about 150 back-end computers would be 
needed.

Trigger signals from each subdetector will be collected and pre-processed by a 
trigger electronics module, similar in design to the NDS %\fixme{?} 
 trigger or master clock modules 
of the NDS-DAQ design. Depending on the run mode, this module could feed local trigger 
decisions to the detector DAQs for data collection, or it could forward NDS %\fixme{?} 
triggers 
from the NDS-DAQ or higher levels to the neutrino detector DAQs.  A slave-clock electronics 
module, similar to the master-clock module in the NDS-DAQ, distributes clock- and 
time-synchronization signals from the NDS-DAQ to all NND subdetectors.

\subsection{Humidity and Temperature Monitoring } % in the STT, ECAL, MuID, and Magnet}

Humidity is detrimental to all the FGT subdetectors. To maintain a low level of 
humidity and to maintain a desired temperature, both STT and ECAL subdetectors
will have dry nitrogen circulating within their outer layers. A similar arrangement 
might be made for the RPCs, as well. Regarding the magnets, magnet coils are cooled by water, 
while the magnet yokes are instrumented with RPCs that must remain dry. 
 Thus, a continuous control of 
humidity in all these detectors is needed.
Just as for humidity, temperature must be continuously monitored in all of the subdetectors
in order for the electronics to not overheat. 

\subsection{Gas Leak Monitoring in the STT and MuID}

Gas leaks need to be monitored in the STT and MuID.
The STT will employ Xe gas, which helps with the measurement of transition radiation.
Xe gas is expensive and, hence, will be recirculated; leak-monitoring is particularly important here.   
The requirement on leaks is less 
stringent for the RPCs, which have less expensive gas.

\subsection{Magnet Monitoring}

The water flow (pressure gradient) will be continuously monitored in order to ensure 
that the magnet does not overheat.  %\fixme{Add more or remove section, I'd say and . AH}
Also, all power sources instrumenting the FGT and its readout need to be monitored for 
appropriate voltage and current.
